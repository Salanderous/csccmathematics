Computing antiderivatives is not as easy as computing derivatives.
One issue is that the chain rule can be difficult to ``undo.''  We
have a general method called ``integration by substitution'' that will
somewhat help with this difficulty. 

If the functions are differentiable, we can apply the chain rule and obtain
\[
\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
\]
If the derivatives are continuous, we can use this equality to evaluate a definite integral. Namely,
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b f'(g(x))g'(x) dx &= \bigg[ f(g(x)) \bigg]_a^b \\
  &= f(g(b)) - f(g(a)). \\
 \end{align*}
On the other hand, it is also true that
\begin{align*}
  \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f'(u) du &= \bigg[ f(u) \bigg]_{g(a)}^{g(b)}\\
  &= f(g(b)) - f(g(a)). \\
 \end{align*}
 Since the right hand sides of these equalities are equal,  the left hand sides must be equal, too. So, it follows that
 
\[
  \int_a^b f'(g(x))g'(x) dx =  \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f'(u) du .
\]
