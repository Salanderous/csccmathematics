Computing antiderivatives is not as easy as computing derivatives.
One issue is that the chain rule can be difficult to ``undo.''  We
have a general method called ``integration by substitution'' that will
somewhat help with this difficulty. 

If the functions are differentiable, we can apply the chain rule and obtain
\[
\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
\]
If the derivatives are continuous, we can use this equality to evaluate a definite integral. Namely,
\begin{align*}
  \int_a^b f'(g(x))g'(x) dx &= \bigg[ f(g(x)) \bigg]_a^b \\
  &= f(g(b)) - f(g(a)). \\
 \end{align*}
On the other hand, it is also true that
\begin{align*}
  \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f'(u) du &= \bigg[ f(u) \bigg]_{g(a)}^{g(b)}\\
  &= f(g(b)) - f(g(a)). \\
 \end{align*}
 Since the right hand sides of these equalities are equal,  the left hand sides must be equal, too. So, it follows that
 
\[
  \int_a^b f'(g(x))g'(x) dx =  \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f'(u) du .
\]

 
This simple observation  leads to the following theorem. 


\begin{theorem}[Integral Substitution Formula]\index{integral substitution formula} 
Let $g'$ be the derivative of a  function $g$ and let $f'$ be the derivative of a function $f$. If $g'$ is continuous on the interval $[a,b]$ and  $f'$ is
continuous on the interval $[g(a),g(b)]$, then
\[
\int_a^b f'(g(x)) g'(x) dx =\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f'(u) du.
\]
\end{theorem}
The integral on the right appears to be much simpler than the original integral.
So, when evaluating a difficult integral,  we try to apply this theorem and replace the original integral with a simpler one.
 We can do this as long as the conditions of the theorem are satisfied.

We will apply the Integral Substitution Formula (ISF)  to the following example.

\begin{example}
Compute:
\[
\int_0^2 x e^{x^2} dx
\]
\begin{explanation}
Why do we think that the ISF can be useful in this example?

Does this integral have the structure
\[
\int_a^b f'(g(x)) g'(x)  dx ,  
\]
so that we can apply the ISF?

We set $g(x) =x^2$, so $g'(x)dx =2xdx$, and note that

\[
\int_0^2 x e^{x^2} dx
=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2} e^{\underbrace{x^2}}\underbrace{2x dx}=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2} e^{g(x)}g'(x) dx
\]
So we wrote the integral in a form suitable for application of the ISF. Therefore, we can substitute $u$ for $g(x)$ and $ du$ for $g'(x) dx$ and write

\[
\int_0^2 x e^{x^2} dx=\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{2} e^{g(x)}g'(x) dx=\frac{1}{2}\int_{g(0)}^{g(2)} e^{u} du
\]
Now, compute the endpoints: 
\begin{align*}
g(0) &= 0^2 = 0  \\
g(2) &=2^2 = 4.
\end{align*}
We can easily evaluate the last integral
\[
\frac{1}{2}\int_{g(0)}^{g(2)} e^{u} du=
\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{4} e^{u} du=\frac{1}{2}\bigg[ e^u \bigg]_0^4=\frac{1}{2}\left(\answer[given]{e^4}-e^0\right)=\frac{\answer[given]{e^4}-1}{2}
\]
In summary,
