Determine the integral

\[
\int \sec^{2}(x) \tan(x) dx
\]

We solve this integral in two different ways


First let $u=\tan(x)$. Then $du=\answer{ \sec^{2}(x)}$. 

Then the integral in terms of $u$ is
\[
\int \answer{u} du
\]

Integrating and going back to $x$ we get:
\[
\int \sec^{2}(x)\tan(x) dx= \answer{  \frac{ \tan^{2}(x)}{2}  + C}
\]
Use $C$ for the constant of integration. 

\begin{exercise}

Now let us do a different substitution to find the integral. Let $u=\sec(x)$. Then $du=\answer{ \sec(x) \tan(x)} dx$

Then the integral in terms of $u$ becomes:

\[
\int \answer{u} du 
\]

Integrating and going back to $x$ gives us:

\[
\int \sec^{2}(x) \tan(x) dx= \answer{  \frac{ \sec^{2}(x) }{2}+ C}
\]
Use $C$ for the constant of integration. 

Note that the answer you obtained from the second substitution seems to differ from the answer we obtained using the first substitution. Recall there is a theorem that all antiderivatives 
of a given function can only differ by a constant. Can you explain this apparent discrepancy?
