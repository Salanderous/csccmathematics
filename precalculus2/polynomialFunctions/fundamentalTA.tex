The previous examples are very suggestive that polynomials factor into a product of linear factors.  There are as many linear factors as the degree of the polynomial, if you count multiplicities. \\






\begin{theorem} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (Complex)}} 



Let $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients. \\


Then $p(x)$ can be written as a product of linear factors:

\[
 a (x - r_n) (x - r_{n-1}) \cdots (x - r_2)  (x - r_1) 
\]


where $r_i \in \mathbb{C}$.


\end{theorem}








\begin{theorem} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (Real)}} 



Let $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ with real coefficients. \\


Then $p(x)$ can be written as a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors with real coefficients.


\end{theorem}


Our intuition is correct if we allow complex numbers to be used.  If we wish to stay inside the real numbers for our coefficients, then we can factor into linear and irreducible quadratics.  Irreducible quadratics have complex roots, so cannot be factored over the reals.
