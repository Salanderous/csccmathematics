Polynomial functions are our``go to'' functions.  They are like decimal numbers for functions.  

When you need to approximate a number, you select a decimal expansion with enough digits to give you the accuracy you desire. When you need to approximate a function, you select a polynomial with enough terms to give you the accuracy your desire. 

We will do plenty of this in Calculus.

So, we want to know everything about polynomials.


















\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item paint a full picture of polynomials.
\item use the Rational Roots Theorem.
\item complete the picture of polynomials with the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
\end{itemize}
