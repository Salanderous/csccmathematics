As you move through mathematics and science and engineering, you will discover that differential equations are the tool of choice when it comes to describing the world around us.


We generally measure changes in the world, which provides information about the derivative.  Then, we try to piece together the function.

There are many many many methods for reconstructing a function from its derivative.  \textbf{Euler's Method} is the most straightforward.  In fact, we saw it in action in the previous section.
