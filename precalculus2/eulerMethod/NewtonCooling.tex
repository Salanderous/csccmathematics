Newton's Law of Cooling states





In modern notation, we have

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = r \, (T_{env} - T(t))
\]

where $r$ is the coefficient of heat transfer.\\





The derivative (rate of change) of temperature is proportional to the difference betweent the current temperature and the currounding temperature.





We can do better in our example from the last section, by using smaller intervals and reusing the differential equaiton to give us an updated rate.






\begin{example} Law of Cooling 



We can do better. \\



A freshly brewed pot of tea is removed from the stove at $200^{\circ}$.  It is set on the table where the room temperature is $72^{\circ}$ and the heat transfer coefficient is $0.025$. \\


Newton's Law of Cooling says

\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = 0.025 \, (72 - T(t))
\]


where $t$ is measured in minutes.


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Frrst Minute} \\

The tea has an initial temperature of $200^{\circ}$, which means the temperature is changing approximately at a rate of 


\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = 0.025 \, (72 - 200) = 3.2 \, \text{degrees per minute}
\]


After $30$ seconds or $0.5$ minute the tea is at approximately $200^{\circ} - 3.2 \frac{\text{degrees}}{\text{min}} \cdot 0.5 \text{min} = $.


The new rate of cooling at the $30$ second mark is


\[
\frac{dT}{dt} = 0.025 \, (72 - 198.4) = 3.16 \, \, \text{degrees per minute}
\]



After another $30$ seconds or now $1$ minute from teh beginning, the tea is at approximately $198.4^{\circ} - 3.16 \frac{\text{degrees}}{\text{min}} \cdot 0.5 \text{min} = 196.82^{\circ}$.


In the previous section we arrived at $196.8^{\circ}$.

\end{example}





\begin{observation}

Our revised calcualtion is higher than the previous.  That is because the rate decreases over time.  In the example in the previous section we used a higher rate over a longer time interval.

This time we revised our rate and it was lower during the second $30$ second period.  Thus, the tea did not cool as much as before.
