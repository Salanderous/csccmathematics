What do we want when analyzing a function?


$\blacktriangleright$ First, and foremost, we want an algebraic description of every detail about our function. 

\begin{itemize}
\item domain
\item zeros 
\item dicsontinuities and singularities
\item intervals of continuity
\item critical numbers
\item intervals where increasing and decreasing
\item global maximum and minimium
\item local maximums and minimums
\item end-behavior
\item limiting behavior
\end{itemize}



$\blacktriangleright$ Secondly, we would like a nice graph, including corresponding important points and auxillary graphing items.

\begin{itemize}
	\item intercepts
	\item endpoints
	\item vertical asymptotes
	\item horizontal asymptotes
\end{itemize}




We often turn to technology for a nice graph and we must remember that it is plotting individual points and may not understand the larger implications. As humans, we possess more imformation from our algebraic description and can enhance the graph with exaggerations and auxillary graphing items to help the reader understand the function better.
