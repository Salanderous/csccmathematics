We have investigated formulas for derivative in a couple of situations.


We began with the value of the derivative as the slope of the tangent line.

The constant function $f(x) = c$ has a horizontal line as its graph and every tangent line is also a horizontal tangent line with slope $0$.


\[
\text{If } \, f(x) = c, \, \text{ then } \, f'(x) = 0
\]



The linear function $g(t) = a \, t + b$ has a line as its graph and every tangent line is also that same line with slope $a$.



\[
\text{If } \, g(t) = a \, x + b, \, \text{ then } \, g'(t) = a
\]




The quadratic function $q(r) = a \, r^2 + b \, r + c$ has the linear function $2a \, r + b$ as its derivative.





Looking at this in reverse, we might notice that a quadratic function has a derivative, which is a linear function, which has a derivative, which is a constant function, which has a derivative, which is the $0$ function.



Capturing this sequence of derivatives is the idea behing \textbf{higher order derivatives}.









\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Higher Order Derivatives}} \\


Let $f(x)$ be a function. \\


Its derivative is also known as the \textbf{first derivative of $f(x)$} and is symbolize by \textbf{$f^{\prime}(x)$} or \textbf{$\frac{df}{dx}$}.

This first derivative of $f(x)$ is a function and has a derivative known as the \textbf{second derivative of $f(x)$} and is symbolize by \textbf{$f^{\prime\prime}(x)$} or \textbf{$\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$} or \textbf{$f^{(2)}(x)$}.


This second derivative of $f(x)$ is a function and has a derivative known as the \textbf{third derivative of $f(x)$} and is symbolize by \textbf{$f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)$} or \textbf{$\frac{d^3f}{dx^3}$} or \textbf{$f^{(3)}(x)$}.


In general, the \textbf{$n^{th}$ derivative} is symbolized by \textbf{$\frac{d^{n}f}{dx^n}$} or \textbf{$f^{(n)}(x)$}.


\end{definition}




\begin{example}


Let $G(t) = 4 \sin(t)$. Then,\\

$G^{\prime}(t) = 4 \cos(t)$ \\

$\frac{d^{2}G}{dt^{2}} = -4 \sin(t)$ \\

$\frac{d^{3}G}{dt^{3}} = -4 \cos(t)$ \\

$\frac{d^{4}G}{dt^{4}} = 4 \sin(t)$ \\

Back to $G(t)$.
