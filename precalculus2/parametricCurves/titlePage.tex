Curves are a collection of points in the plane.  This collection of points might be described with a Cartesian equation, like $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.  It might be described with a polar equation, like $r = cos(\theta)$.

However, you describe it, the curve is a collection of points and these points each have two coordinates.


A parametric description is one where each coordinate is described separately as its own function. Both of these coordinate funcitons share a domain coming from a third set.
