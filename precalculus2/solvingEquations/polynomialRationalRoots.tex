Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with rational coefficients.

\[   f(x) = b_n x^n + b_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0     \]


where $b_k \in \mathbb{Q}$:  $b_k = \frac{n_k}{d_k}$


Then we could get a common denominator of all of the coefficients and factor that out front



\[   f(x) = \frac{1}{d}(c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0)    \]


These are the same polynomial, so that have the same roots and factorization.


So, when we are investigating zeros and roots and factors, we can always assume that a polynomial with rational coefficients just has integer coefficents.




\section{Rational Roots}

Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients.

\[   f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0     \]


Suppose $f(x)$ has a rational root:  $\frac{N}{D}$ in reduced form.  That is $N$ and $D$ do not share any prime factors.



That means


\[    f \left( \frac{N}{D} \right) = a_n \left( \frac{N}{D} \right)^n + a_{n-1} \left( \frac{N}{D} \right)^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2 \left( \frac{N}{D} \right)^2 + a_1 \left( \frac{N}{D} \right) + a_0  = 0       \]
