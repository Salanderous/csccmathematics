Completely analyze $K(v) = \ln(x^2+2x+3)$

$\blacktriangleright$  The implied domain is all real numbers that make the inside function, $v^2+2v+3$, greater than $0$.  So, we need some information on $v^2+2v+3$.   Let's give this funciton the name $in(v) = v^2+2v+3$

$in(v)$ is a quadratic function.  Its leading coeffident is positive, therefore the graph would be a parabola opening up.  That tells us $in(v)$ has an absoute minimum.  The quadratic formula tells us that the minimum occurs at $v=\frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1$.

The minimum value is $in(-1) = 2$.  Therefore, $in(v) > 0$ for all $v$.

Therefore, the implied domain of $K(v)$ is all real numbers.

Since, $\ln(r)$ is an increasing funciton.
