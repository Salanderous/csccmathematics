The real number line had just one dimension, which made the idea of direction simple.  But it did possess directions - two of them: left and right.  These were commonly known as positive and negative.  Each number was descirbed with two pieces of information.  Each number came with a direction and a distance.


We represented the direction with a hyphen (for negative) to the left of the distance or the absence of the hyphen (for positive).

The Complex Numbers have many more directions, but the idea is the same.  Each complex number can be described with a direction and a distance.  This type of representation is known as \textbf{polar form}.
