The real number line had just one dimension, which made the idea of direction simple - two of them: left and right.  These were commonly known as the positive and negative directions.  Each number was described with two pieces of information.  Each number came with a direction and a distance.  We usually give the direction information first and then the distance.


\begin{itemize}
\item For example $-3$.  The hyphen out front means the left (negative) direction and the $3$ gives the distance.
\item For example $+5$.  The plus sign out front means the right (positive) direction and the $5$ gives the distance.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} We usually do not write the $+$, $+3 = 3$.

We represented the direction with a hyphen (for negative) to the left of the distance or the absence of the hyphen (for positive).

The Complex Numbers have many more directions, but the idea is the same.  Each complex number can be described with a direction and a distance.  This type of representation is known as \textbf{polar form}.
