Our goal in Calculus is to analyze functions.


This means describing the function's behavior.

Calculus will provide procedures for obtaining the derivative of any function.  However, for compositions, we can get the same behavior informaiton right now.



\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item view functions as compositions.
