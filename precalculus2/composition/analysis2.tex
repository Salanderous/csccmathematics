Analyze $H(x) = 5 \ln(\sqrt{x^2-3})$ with its natural domain. \\

Our plan is to view this as a composition. \\






We are looking for functions $f$ and $g$ such that $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = 5 \ln(\sqrt{x^2-3})$ \\


First, identify ``insides'' of functions.  In this case, $x^2 - 3$ is the inside of $5 \ln(\sqrt{x})$. \\




Let $f(t) = 5 \ln(\sqrt{t})$. \\

Let $g(y) = y^2 - 3$. \\


Algebraically, this produces the formula want, $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x)) = 5 \ln(\sqrt{x^2-3})$.



We are ready to analyze. \\




\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Domain:}} \\


$H$ is not a logarithmic function, since the inside is not a linear function.  However, it includes a logarithm. We need $x^2-3 > 0$.  Therefore, the domain of $H$ is $(-\infty, -\sqrt{3}) \cup (\sqrt{3}, \infty)$. \\



\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Zeros:}} \\




\[
5 \ln(\sqrt{x^2-3}) = 0
\]


\[
\ln(\sqrt{x^2-3}) = 0
\]


\[
\sqrt{x^2-3} = 1
\]


\[
x^2-3 = 1
\]

\[
x^2 = 4
\]


We have two zeros, $-2$ and $2$. \\




\textbf{\textcolor{blue!55!black}{Continuity:}} \\


$H$ is a composition of a logarithmic function and a quadratic funciton.  Both of these are continuous, which means their composition is continuous. \\

Loagrithmic functions do not have discontinuites, but they do have singularities.  $H$ has singularities where
