Direction vectors or unit vectors are vectors or length $1$, which makes the unit circle the key to understanding the Complex Numbers. \\ 



We can describe every complex number by providing a complex number on the unit circle to give the direction and then a distance to move in that direction.  \\ 


We have already described complex numbers on the unit circle with sine and cosine: $cos(\theta) + sin(\theta) \, i$.  This came from investigating the right triangle formed from points on the unit circle. \\

\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item examine the unit circle via right triangles.
\item decompose vectors into perpendicular components.
\item describe components with sine and cosine.
\item describe complex numbers with this information
\end{itemize}
