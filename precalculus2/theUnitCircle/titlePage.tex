We have seen that \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{EVERY}} complex number can be written as a scalar multiple of a direction vector.

Direction vectors are vectors or length $1$, which makes the unit circle the key to understanding the Complex Numbers.






\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item examine the unit circle via right triangles.
\item decompose vectors into perpendicular components.
\item describe components with sine and cosine.
\end{itemize}
