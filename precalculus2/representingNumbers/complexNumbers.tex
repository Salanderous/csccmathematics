We have whittled our investigation down to a study of real-valued functions.  These are functions whose domain and range are both subsets of the real numbers.  Basically, Precalculus 1 is a study of the real numbers.

This means we have a need to communicate about sets of real numbers.  We have several ways of communicating our ideas of real numbers.
