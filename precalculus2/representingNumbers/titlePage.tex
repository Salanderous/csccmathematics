We know the real numbers from our representations.  We algebraic representations and then operations that tell us how we may manipulate the symbols. We have visual representations of numbers.  Our number line comes with two tools: dots and arrows.  We use both to describe how the real numbers combine.

We would like to extend this idea from one-dimesions to two-dimensions.
