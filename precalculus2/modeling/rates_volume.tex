We can also measure volume and how it changes.



\[
\text{rate} = \frac{\Delta \text{volume}}{\Delta \text{time}} 
\]








\subsection{Conical Tank}

A conical tank (with vertex down) is 12 feet across and 14 fee deep. If water is flowing into the tank at a rate of 9 cubic feet per minute, find the rate of change of the depth of the water when the water is 8 feet deep.

$\blacktriangleright$ We begin with three pertinent lengths that remain constant throughout the story:

\begin{itemize}
\item $R$ is the radius of the base of the conical tank.
\item $H$ is the height of the conical tank.
\end{itemize}

These are constant functions of time, $t$: $R(t)$ and $H(t)$.







\begin{question} $\boxdot$ 

As water pours into the tank, what shape does the water take?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice {Triangle}
\choice {Sphere}
\choice[correct] {Cone}
\choice {Rectangular Prism}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}









\begin{question} $\boxdot$ 

As water pours into the tank, how does the height of the water change?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct] {Increases}
\choice {Decreases}
\choice {Remains Constant}
\end{multipleChoice}

\end{question}







\begin{question} $\boxdot$ 

As water pours into the tank, how does the radius of the water base change?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice[correct] {Increases}
\choice {Decreases}
\choice {Remains Constant}
\end{multipleChoice}
