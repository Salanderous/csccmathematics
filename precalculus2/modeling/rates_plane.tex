\begin{center}
\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Distance = Rate $\cdot$ Time}} 
\end{center}

This relationship is extremely common in our situations.  We might see it as



\begin{center}
\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Length = Rate $\cdot$ Time}} 
\end{center}



However, these are not exactly correct.  The relationship is not between distance and time.  The rate is a comparison measurement between \textcolor{red!80!black}{change in length} and \textcolor{red!80!black}{change in time}.



\[
\text{rate} = \frac{\Delta \text{length}}{\Delta \text{time}} = \frac{\Delta \text{distance}}{\Delta \text{time}}
\]

\textbf{Note:} $\Delta$ is our shorthand notation for ``change in''. \\






\subsection{Airplane}

An airplane is flying overhead on a level flight path, 5 miles above the ground.  The plane is travelling at a constant speed and will travel directly over a tracking station. The tracking station's radar antennea measures the distance from the station to the plane.

$\blacktriangleright$ We have three pertinent lengths:

\begin{itemize}
\item $D$ is the distance between the station and the plane.
\item $F$ is the flight distance between the plane the point directly above the station.
\item $H$ is the height of the flight path above the station.
\end{itemize}

All of these are functions of time, $t$: $D(t)$, $F(t)$, and $H(t)$.


\begin{question} $\boxdot$ 

Which distance measurement is a constant function?

\begin{multipleChoice}

\begin{question} $\boxdot$ 

Is $D(t)$ an increasing or decreasing function with respect to $t$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice {Increasing}
\choice[correct] {Decreasing}

\end{question}



\begin{question} $\boxdot$ 

Is $F(t)$ an increasing or decreasing function with respoect to $t$?

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice {Increasing}
\choice[correct] {Decreasing}
\end{multipleChoice}

\textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{Step 3: Geometric Relationships}}


An airplane is flying overhead on a level flight path, 5 miles above the ground.  The plane is travelling at a constant speed and will travel directly over a tracking station. The tracking station's radar antennea measures the distance from the station to the plane. If the distance between the station and the plane is decreasing at a rate of $350$ miles per hour when that distance is $10$ miles, then what is the speed of the plane?
