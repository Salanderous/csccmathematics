\textbf{Completely analyze $L(x) = \frac{5}{1+3 e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}}$} \\






$\blacktriangleright$  \textbf{Domain:} $x$ is a real number and the range of the exponential function does not include negative numbers. Therefore, the denominator of $L(x)$ cannot be $0$.  That makes the natural or implied domain all real numbers.


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Zeros:} $L$ is a quotient, therefore the zeros of $L$ would be the zeros of the numerator.  However, the numerator is a constant funciton.  It has no zeros. $L$ has no zeros.



$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Continuity:} The denominator is a shifted exponential funciton, so it is continuous everywhere. The numberator is a constant funciton, so it is continuopus everywhere.  $L$ is the quotient of two continuous functions.  Therefore, it is continuous except where the denominator is $0$.  The denominator is never $0$. $L$ is continuous everywhere.  No discontinuities or singularities.




$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Range:} S$L$ is a continuous function and is never negative. We need to determine the endbehavior to understand the range.


First, $e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}$ has a limiting value of $0$ as $x \to \infty$.


\[   \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{5}{1+3 e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}} =   \frac{5}{1 + 0}   = 5 \]



Second, $e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}$ is unbounded as $x \to -\infty$ and domaintes $1$ in the denominator.

\[   \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{5}{1+3 e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}} =   \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{5}{3 e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}}   = 0 \]



Our range is $(0, 5)$.


The graph has horizontal asymptotes.

          \addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=100,domain=(-9:9),<->] {5/(1 + 3 * 2.7182^(-x/2))};

$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Rate-of-Change:}    Since $e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}$ is a strictly decreasing function, the denominator is decreasing to $1$. The numerator is a constant function. A fraction with a constant numerator and decreasing denominator gets larger. $L(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.





$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Extrema:}  $L(x)$ has no global maximums or minimums, since it is a strictly increasing function.  


But, it could wiggle slightly in the middle. The might be a bump in the graph that we cannot see at our magnification.

Right now, with our technology, it appears that $L$ has no local maximums or minimums. 



\section{with Calculus}


Calculus will give us a formula for the derivative.

\[  L'(x) =   \frac{-15}{2} \cdot \frac{e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}}{\left(1+3 e^{-\tfrac{x}{2}}\right)^2}    \]


This function has no zeros, which tells us that $L(x)$ has no critical numbers.
