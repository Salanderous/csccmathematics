The function $y(x)$ is described by $x^3 + y^3 - 3 x y = 0$, except it isn't a function.



The graph of $x^3 + y^3 - 3 x y = 0$ looks like

As you can see, no matter how you restrict the domain alone around the loop, it still isn't a function. The range must also be restricted in conjunction with the domain.

However, with suitable domain and range restrictions, $y(x)$ can be a function. \\


Once we have refocused our attention to just a piece of the curve and we have a working function, we can talk about its instantaneous rate of change.  The idea is the same as before.  The value of the derivative at a domain number is the slope of the associated tangent line.


At this point we are approximating with our graoup via technology, because our algebra is unable to break this cubic apart.



Fortunately, Calculus can lend a hand.




\section{with Calculus}

Let's consider $y(1)$.  There are three scenarios for our function $y$.


\begin{center}
\desmos{83u6jqgicu}{400}{300}
\end{center}

Each scenario has its own restricted range, which then identifies one of the three points on the curve.



With $x=1$, our equation becomes $y^3 - 3 y + 1 = 0$ and we find ourselves, once again, looking for zeros of a function. From the graph, it appears that these zeros are approximately $-1.9$, $0.35$, and $1.5$.

How might we obtain better approximations?


Well, how well does $1.5$ do as a zero of the function $f(y) = y^3 - 3 y + 1$ ?


\[  f(1.5) = 1.5^3 - 3 \cdot 1.5 + 1 = -0.125 \]


How should we change $1.5$ to obtain a better approximation to the actual zero? \\


We notice that $f(1.5)$ is is negative - too low.  We need to increase $f$ a little bit.  How do we do this?  Well, it depends on the rate of change of $f$ around $1.5$.  We need a derivative.

And, now we are in Calculus.


Well, it turns out in Calculus, we can get a FORMULA for the derivative.



The good news is that $f(y) = y^3 - 3 y + 1$ is a polynomial and there is a nice procedure to get derivatives of polynomials.


\[
f'(x) = 3 y^2 - 3
\]


We are in a loop. We looking for the value of $y'(1)$, so that we can get a better approximation to $y(1)$. However, to get $y'(1)$, we need $y(1)$.

While we do not have the algebra tools to solve for these values exactly, Calculus allows us to inch closer.



\begin{example} Approximating


Remember, we are examining $y$ near $x = 1$.   More specifically, we are restrict our range to a small interval around $y = 1.5$.  

We set $x = 1$ and obtained a function $f(y)$ and we are looking for its zero, which should be around $1.5$.


Remember, our zero was off by $-0.125$.  We need the value of $f$ to change by $0.125$.


Now, we have a derivative, $f'(1.5) = 3 (1.5)^2 - 3 = 3.75$


The derivative tells us that $\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta y} \approx 3.75$. \\

Therefore, if we wish $\Delta f = 0.125$, then we need 



\[
\frac{0.125}{\Delta y} \approx 3.75
\]


\[
\Delta y \approx \frac{0.125}{3.75} = \frac{1}{30}
\]


Try $y = 1.5 + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{23}{15}$.


\[  f\left( \frac{23}{15} \right) \approx 0.005037037 \]


Pretty good!


Our point should be close to $\left(1, \frac{23}{15} \right) \approx (1, 1.53333)$


The derivative allows us to inch our way closer and closer and closer to values our algebra cannot reach.

\end{example}



Whew!  That was quite the tangent to get a good approximation to our point.

\[ y(1) \approx 1.53333   \]


What about $y'(1)$?



\textbf{\textcolor{red!80!black}{$\blacktriangleright$  [Weird Stuff]}}  Even though we cannot solve for $y$ and get a formula for $y(x)$, Calculus does give us a way to obtain a FORMULA for $y'(x)$.



\[
y'(x) = \frac{y - x^2}{y^2 - x}
\]


It is a weird formula, because it involves both $x$ and $y$.  The analysis of implicit functions is not quite as clean as with explicitly defined functions.


\[
y'(1) \approx \frac{1.53333 - 1^2}{1.5333^2 - 1} \approx 0.394737
\]



From this we can get an approximate tangent line.

\[
y - 1.53333 = 0.394737(x-1)
\]


\[
y = 0.394737(x-1) + 1.53333
\]

\section{without Calculus}



Calculus gives us the derivative, which tells us how to change domain values to affect change in function values.  This allows us to move around proportionaly.  

This is called \textbf{linearization} and is studied later in the course.

Without Calculus, it is difficult to talk algebraically about changing values.  However, technology will crunch the numbers much quicker and allow us to think about the larger picture, approximately.



\begin{example}

Define $y(x)$ by $x^3 + y^3 - 3 x y = 0$ with domain around $1$ and range around $1.5$.


We can work graphically with DESMOS to obtain numberic information, which we can then use to create equaitons of tangent lines.







\begin{center}
\desmos{83u6jqgicu}{400}{300}
\end{center}



What about a derivative?

We can trace the curve in DESMOS and obtain nearby approximations.


We can zoom in on the point and use the gridlines to approximate coordinates.






\begin{center}
\desmos{wkzdfrdom3}{400}{300}
\end{center}

It appears that $y(1) \approx 1.532$.



We can zoom in untilk the graph itself looks like a tangent line.



\begin{center}
\desmos{agpg5z5wwj}{400}{300}
\end{center}

A couple of points might be $(0.995, 1.5302)$ and $(1.005, 1.534)$.

That gives us an approximate slope of 

\[
\frac{1.534 - 1.5302}{1.005 - 0.995} = \frac{0.0038}{0.01} = 0.38
\]


Pretty good!
