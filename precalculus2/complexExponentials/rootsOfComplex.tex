Roots of any complex number.  Or real








Euler's Formula tells us that $e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \, \sin(i \theta)$, which describes all of the points on the unit circle.

We also know that every nonzero Complex number is a scalar (positive real number) times a number on the unit circle:  $r e^{i \theta}$.

We also know that every positive real number can be written as an exponential: $r = e^{ln(r)}$.

Therefore, every Complex number can be written as a complex exponential: $ e^{ln(r) + i \theta}$


\[   a + b \, i =    e^{ln(r) + i \theta}   \]

\[   \text{ where } \,   r = |a + b \, i| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}   \, \text{ and } \,   \theta = ArcTan\left (\frac{b}{a} \right) \pm 2k\pi\]





\section{$n^{th}$ roots of Unity}


Focusing on the Complex numbers on the unit circle, they can be written in the form $e^{i \theta}$.


This would include all of the solutions to $z^n = 1$, with $n$ a Natural number - the roots of unity.




If we are looking for solutions to $(e^{i \theta})^n = 1$, then we need $n \cdot \theta = 2k\pi$, for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$.


Therefore, the $n^{th}$ roots of $1$ are equally spaced on the unit circle.  Begin with $1$, then go $\frac{1}{n^{th}}$ around the circle, then another, then another, until you get back to the beginning.




\begin{example}  Cube roots of Unity

There are $3$ third roots of unity.

$1$ is the first.

Then move $\frac{1}{3}$ of a circle ($120^{\circ}$) to $e^{\tfrac{2 \pi}{3} i} = \cos\left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right) + i \, \sin\left(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\right) = \frac{-1}{2} + i \, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

Then move another $\frac{1}{3}$ of a circle ($240^{\circ}$) to $e^{\tfrac{4 \pi}{3} i} = \cos\left(\frac{4 \pi}{3}\right) + i \, \sin\left(\frac{4 \pi}{3}\right) = \frac{-1}{2} - i \, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$



Then move another $\frac{1}{3}$ of a circle, which returns you to $1$.




\end{example}











\begin{example}  Fourth roots of Unity

There are $4$ fourth roots of unity.

$1$ is the first.

A quarter circle gets you to $i$. 

Another quarter circle gets you to $-1$. 

Another quarter circle gets you to $-i$. 

Another quarter circle gets you back to $1$.
