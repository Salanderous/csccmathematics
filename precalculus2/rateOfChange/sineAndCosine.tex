In the graph below, 

\begin{itemize}
\item the measurement for the angle $\theta$ is plotted horizontally
\item $\sin(\theta)$ is the blue curve
\item the line is a tangent line to $\sin(\theta)$
\item the slope of the tangent line is a number and is plotted as the red dot
\end{itemize}

As you move long the $\sin(\theta)$ curve, the slope of the tangent line follows the dotted $\cos(\theta)$ curve.

$\cos(\theta)$ is the derivative of $\sin(\theta)$.  Its values measure the instantaneous rate of change of $\sin(\theta)$.

As you move long the $\cos(\theta)$ curve, the slope of the tangent line follows the dotted $-\sin(\theta)$ curve.
