Let $f(x) = 3 \cdot 4^{x}$.


\begin{question}


Evaluate $f(1) = \answer{12}$


Evaluate $f(2) = \answer{48}$


What was the increase in $f$, when the domain increased by $1$, from $1$ to $2$?   

$f(2) - f(1) = \answer{36}$.


What was the percentage increase?   

\[
\frac{f(2) - f(1)}{f(1)} = \answer{3}, \text{ which is a } \answer{300}\% \text{ increase. }
\]
