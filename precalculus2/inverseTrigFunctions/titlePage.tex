Sine, cosine, and tangent are functions. The connect angle measurements (degree and radian) with ratios (numbers). Unfortunately, they are not one-to-one functions and do not have inverse functions. \\

But, we would like them to.\\

In order to get inverse functions, we need to make sine, cosine, and tangent one-to-one functions.  To accomplish this, we'll simply restrict their domains.
