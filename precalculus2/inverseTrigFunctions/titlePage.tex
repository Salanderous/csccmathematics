Sine, cosine, and tangent are functions. They connect angle measurements (degrees and radians) with ratios (numbers). Unfortunately, they are not one-to-one functions and do not have inverse functions. \\

But, we would like them to.\\

In order to get inverse functions, we need to make sine, cosine, and tangent into one-to-one functions.  To accomplish this, we'll simply restrict their domains.
