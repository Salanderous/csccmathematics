\maketitle

When we compute average velocity, we look at 
\[
\frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}}.
\]
To obtain the (instantaneous) velocity, we want the change in time to
``go to'' zero. By this point we should know that ``go to'' is a
buzz-word for a \emph{limit}. The change in time is often given as
the length of a time interval, and this length goes to zero.

The average velocity on the (time) interval $[a,b]$ is given by
\[
v_{\text{av}} = 
\frac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}} =
\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}.
\]
Here $s(t)$ denotes the position, at the time $t$, of an object moving along a line.

Let's put all of this together by working an example.

\begin{example}
A young mathematician throws a ball straight into the air with 
a velocity of 40ft/sec. Its height (in feet) after $t$ seconds 
is given by
\[
s(t) = 40t-16t^2 \qquad\text{(feet above the ground)} .
\]
Here is the graph of $s$.











\begin{question}
When will the ball hit the ground?

\begin{explanation}
To determine when the ball hits the ground we need to solve the
equation
\[
s(t)=0
\]
for t.  That is,
\begin{align*}
40t-16t^2 &= 0\\
t(40-16t) &= 0.
\end{align*}
This  equation has two solutions, one of them is $t=0$
seconds.
 
   Since the ball hits
the ground  some time after it's
thrown, we conclude that the ball hits the ground at time when $t>0$.
\end{explanation}
The ball will hit ground at the time
\[
t=\answer[given]{2.5}seconds.
\]

\end{question}
\begin{question}
What is the height of the ball after $2$ seconds?

\begin{explanation}
In order to find the height of the ball after $2$ seconds, we simply need 
to plug $2$ into the equation for $s(t)$.
\end{explanation} 
The height of the ball after $2$ seconds is
\[
s(2) = 40\cdot\answer[given]{2} - 16\cdot\answer[given]{2}^2 = 
\answer[given]{16}\mathrm{ft.}
\]

\end{question}

 Consider the following points lying along the $s$ axis.

























\begin {question}
 Which points correspond to the height of the ball at time $t=0$, $t=1$ and $t=2$  seconds? 
Make  correct choices!

\begin{enumerate}
\item The point that corresponds to $s(0)$, the position (height) of the 
ball at $t=0$, is 
\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{A}
\choice[correct]{B}
\choice{C}
\choice{D}
\end{multipleChoice} 
\item The point that corresponds to $s(1)$, the position (height) of the 
ball at $t=1$, is 
\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{A}
\choice{B}
\choice{C}
\choice[correct]{D}
\end{multipleChoice} 


\item The point that corresponds to $s(2)$, the position (height) of the 
ball at $t=2$, is 
\begin{multipleChoice} 
\choice{A}
\choice{B}
\choice[correct]{C}
\choice{D}
\end{multipleChoice} 
\end{enumerate}
\end {question}

Next let's consider the average velocity of the ball.
\begin{question}
 What is the average velocity of the ball on the time interval $[1,2]$?


\begin{explanation}
In order to find the average velocity of the ball on the 
interval $[1,2]$ we recall that the average velocity on 
the time interval $[a,b]$ is given by
\[
v_{\text{av}} = 
\frac{s(b) - s\left({a}\right)}
{b-a}.
\]
Now we just plug in $a=1$ and $b=2$. 
\end{explanation}
\[
v_{\text{av}} = \frac{s(2)-s(1)}{2-1} = 
\frac{\answer[given]{16} - \answer[given]{24}}{1} =
\answer[given]{-8}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}.
\] 

Check the figure below.






























\end{question}
\begin{question}
 What is the average velocity of the ball on the time interval
$[t,2]$, for $0<t<2$? 


\begin{explanation}
We use the  formula for average velocity .
\begin{align*}
v_{\text{av}} &= 
\frac{s(2)-s\left({t}\right)}
{{2}-{t}}\\
&= \frac{16 - (40t-16t^2)}{2-t}\\
&= \frac{8(2t^2-5t+2)}{2-t}\\
&= \frac{8(2t-1)\cancel{(t-2)}}{-\cancel{(t-2)}}\\
&= -8(2t-1)\\
&= 8-16t \hspace{0.06in}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s},
\end{align*}
for $0<t<2$.
Check the figure below.





























\end{explanation}
\end{question}
\begin{question}
 What is the average velocity of the ball on the interval $[2,t]$, for
$2<t<2.5$?

\begin {explanation}

The average velocity on the interval $[2,t]$, for 
$2<t<2.5$ is 
\[
v_{\text{av}} = \frac{s(t)-s(2)}{t-2} = \frac{s(2)-s(t)}{2-t}. 
\]
Notice that this is exactly the same expression we got when calculating
the average velocity on the interval $[t,2]$ for $0<t<2$. 
\end{explanation}

The average velocity on the interval $[2,t]$, for $2<t<2.5$, is given by
\[
v_{\text{av}} =\answer[given]{8-16t}\hspace{0.06in}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}.
\]

\end{question}
\begin {question}
 Using the results in Questions 5 and 6,  compute the average velocity on the interval
\begin{enumerate}
\item $[2, 2.1]$
\[
v_{\text{av}} =  8-16(\answer[given]{2.1})=-25.6 \hspace{0.06in}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}
\]
\item $[1.9,2]$
\[
v_{\text{av}} =  8-16(\answer[given]{1.9})=-22.4 \hspace{0.06in}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}
\end{example}

In our previous example, we computed \textit{average velocity} on
several different intervals.

 For example, the average velocity on the time interval  $[2,t]$ is  $v_{\text{av}}=8-16t$.
 
Note that the size or the length of that time interval is $t-2$.

 If we let $t\to 2$, the size of the interval will go to $0$.
 
  So, as $t$ approaches $2$,  we are computing the average velocity on smaller and
  
   smaller time intervals, and the limit of these average velocities  should be called 
 

    the \textbf{instantaneous velocity} at $t=2$.
 
 
  Limits will allow us to compute instantaneous velocity.
  
    Let's use the same setting as before.


\begin{example}
The height of a ball above the ground during the time interval  $[0,2.5]$, with $t$ is in seconds and $s(t)$ in feet, 
is given by
\[
s(t) = 40t - 16t^2.
\] 
Find $v(2)$, the instantaneous velocity of the ball $2$ seconds after it
is thrown.

\begin{explanation}
From the previous example, we know that the average velocity of the
ball on the interval $[t,2]$, for $0<t<2$, and the average velocity
on the interval $[2,t]$, for $2<t<2.5$, are both given by
\[
v_{\text{av}} =  \frac{s(t)-s(2)}{t-2}= 8-16t \hspace{0.06in}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}.
\]
In order to find the instantaneous velocity $v(2)$, we 
take the limit as $t$ goes to $\answer[given]{2}$. 
\begin{align*}
v (2)= \lim_{t\to2}v_{\text{av}}
=\lim_{t\to2}  \frac{s(t)-s(2)}{t-2}
&= \lim_{t\to2}(8-16t)\\
&= \answer[given]{-24}\mathrm{ft}/\mathrm{s}.
\end{align*}
\end{explanation}
\end{example}
