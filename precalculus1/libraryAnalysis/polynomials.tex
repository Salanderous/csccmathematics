\maketitle


Polynomials are functions that can be described by sums power functions


\[    a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x^1 + a_0 x^0      \]

where the $a_k$ are real numbers and $a_n \ne 0$.


\begin{itemize}

\item $n$ is called the \textbf{degree} of the polynomial.
\item $a_k$ are called \textbf{coefficients}.
\item $a_n$ is called the \textbf{leading coefficient}.
\item Each of the summands are called a \textbf{term}.  
\item $a_n x^n$ is called the \textbf{leading term}.
\item $a_2 x^2$ is called the \textbf{quadratic term}.
\item $a_1 x^1$ is called the \textbf{linear term}, often written as $a_1 x$.
\item $a_0 x^0$ is called the \textbf{constant term}, often written as $a_0$.

\end{itemize}







For analytical purposes, we would prefer a product

\[   f(x) = a (x-r_n)(x-r_{n-1})  \cdots (x-r_2)(x-r_1)  \]


\begin{itemize}

\item $a$ is called the \textbf{leading coefficient}.
\item $(x-r_k)$ are called \textbf{factors}.
\item $r_k$ are called the \textbf{zeros} or \textbf{roots}.

\end{itemize}






Polynomials are the nicest functions we have. \\

The graph of $y = f(x) = \frac{1}{100} x^3 + \frac{1}{25} x^2 - \frac{31}{100} x - \frac{7}{10}$

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture} 
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
          \addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth, domain=(-9:9),<->] {0.01*(x+7)*(x+2)*(x-5)};

           

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}



All of their characteristics and features are nice.

\begin{itemize}
\item Their domains include all real numbers. 
\item They are continuous everywhere.
\item No discontinuities or singularities.
\item No asymptotes on the graph.
\item Their graphs are smooth - no corners or endpoints
\end{itemize}


Polynomials smoothly alternative between increasing and decreasing and they switch at maximums and minimums.

As you will see later, polynomials have a limit on the number of zeros and extrema.  They cannot have more than the degree of the polynomial.
