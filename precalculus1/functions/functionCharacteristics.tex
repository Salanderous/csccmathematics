NUmbers have properties.  These define sets of numbers

even

odd

prime

funcitons also have properties which defines sets of funcitons.







\section{Function Characteristics or Properties}










\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Onto}} \\

If the range does equal the codomain, then the function is said to be \textbf{onto}.

\end{definition}









\begin{example} \textit{SuperBowlWinner}


\textit{SuperBowlWinner} is not an onto function.


\begin{itemize}
\item The Cleveland Browns are not in the range of \textit{SuperBowlWinner}.  
\item The Pittsburgh Steelers are in the range of \textit{SuperBowlWinner}.
\end{itemize}

\end{example}







some functions are onto. SOme are not
Some functions are one-to-one. Some are not




















\begin{question} \textit{Successor} \\
The \textit{Successor} function pairs an integer with one more than the integer.

domain = all integers  \\ 
codomain = all integers


\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Successor}($3$) = $4$.
\item \textit{Successor}($-4$) = $-3$.
\item \textit{Successor}($0$) = $1$.
\item \textit{Successor}($\pi$) = $undefined$.

\item $\textit{Successor}(-7) = \answer{-8}$.
\end{itemize}


Solve \textit{Successor}(z) = $-1$ \\

The solution is $d = \answer{-2}$.

\end{question} 







\begin{question} \textit{Successor} \\
Is every integer in the range of \textit{Successor}?


\begin{multipleChoice}
	\choice[correct]{Yes}
	\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
Every integer has a previous integer.  
\end{feedback}


Is \textit{Successor} an onto function?
\begin{multipleChoice}
	\choice[correct]{Yes}
	\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}


\end{question} 








The one and only rule for a function is that each domain item is in exactly one pair.  Range items can be in multiple pairs or no pairs. \\

However, if the range also follows this rule, then the function is called a \textbf{one-to-one} function.






\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{One-to-One}} \\

A \textbf{one-to-one} function is a function in which each range number is in exactly one pair.

\end{definition}



\begin{example}

The \textit{Successor} function is a one-to-one function. \\

Each integer has exactly one previous integer.

\end{example}
