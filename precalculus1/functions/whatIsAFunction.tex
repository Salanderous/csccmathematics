one additional rule

\maketitle




Functions are special relations. While a relation is just two sets of items and some pairings between the two sets, functions satisfy one rule. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Functions are those relations where each domain item is paired with exactly one codomain item.
\item Functions are those relations where each domain item occurs in exactly one pair.
\end{itemize}


This simple rule makes a world of difference. But, we can do a little better for this course.

This course is a study of the real numbers.  Therefore, the domains and ranges of our functions will be subsets of the real numbers.


With the addition of this one rule and the restricting of our domain and codomain to be sets of real numbers, we are ready to begin our journey towards Calculus.
