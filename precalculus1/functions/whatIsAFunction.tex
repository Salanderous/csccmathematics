\section{Functions}

Functions are special relations. While a relation is just two sets of items and some pairings between the two sets, functions satisfy one rule. 


\begin{condition} \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{THE Rule}} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Functions are those relations where each domain item is paired with \underline{exactly} one codomain item, or
\item Functions are those relations where each domain item occurs in \underline{exactly} one pair.
\end{itemize}
\end{condition}





Mathematicians have a funny way of saying \textit{yes} or \textit{no} about a relation possibly being a function. If a supposed function satisfies our one and only rule, then it is said to be a \textbf{well-defined} function.  Otherwise, it is not well-defined.




\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Well-Defined}}

A function is said to be \textbf{well-defined} if it satisfies the one and only rule for a function.
\end{definition}





\begin{example} SSN \\
The \textit{SSN} function has a domain consisting of all U.S. citizens and a codomain of all 9-digit numbers.  \textit{SSN} pairs a U.S. citizen in the domain with the 9-digit number in the codomain that was issued to them as their social security number. 
\\ \\ 
This function is not well-defined, because there are U.S. citizens without a social security number, like many new-born babies.
\end{example}


\begin{example} \textit{ReverseSSN} \\
The \textit{ReverseSSN} function has a domain consisting of all 9-digit numbers and a codomain consisting of all U.S. citizens.  \textit{ReverseSSN} pairs a number in the domain with the person in the codomain who was issued the number as their social security number. 
\\ \\ 
This function is not well-defined, because there are 9-digit numbers that have not been issued as social security numbers.
\end{example}


\begin{example} \textit{RationalAdd} \\
The \textit{RationalAdd} function has a domain consisting of all rational numbers and a codomain consisting of all integers.  \textit{RationalAdd} pairs a rational number in the domain with an integer in the codomain according to the following rule: \\ 
\begin{quote}
Since a chosen domain number is a rational number, it can be represented as $\tfrac{A}{B}$, where $A$ and $B$ are integers. This domain rational number is paired with $A+B$ in the codomain.
\end{quote}
 
This function is not well-defined.  \\

For instance: We know of a rational number that can be represented as $\tfrac{2}{3}$ and thus it would be paired with $5$.  However, the same rational number can also be represented as $\tfrac{4}{6}$ and thus would be paired with $10$.  This violates the only rule we have.  This particular rational number from the domain must be paired with exactly one codomain number, if \textit{RationalAdd} is to be a function.

\begin{warning}
When function values depend on how you write numbers, that is a pretty good clue that the function is not going to be well-defined.
\end{warning}
\end{example}



\begin{example} \textit{SuperBowlWinner}  \\
The \textit{SuperBowlWinner} function has a domain consisting of the NFL Superbowls played and a codomain consisting of all of the NFL teams that have existed.  \textit{SuperBowlWinner} pairs a Superbowl in the domain with the NFL team in the codomain that won that Superbowl.  \\ 
\\
This function is well-defined. Each Superbowl has exactly one winner.
\end{example}



Whew!  

We finally found a well-defined function. That one little rule actually narrows the pool of relations quite a bit.  By focusing our investigation on only functions, this rule will help us study relationships between all kinds of measurements. \\












\section{Function Notation}

Now that we are only investigating functions, rather than all relations, we discover some opportunities to help our communication.  It turns out that when you select a domain item in a function, you have automatically selected a codomain item.

Each domain item is paired with \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{EXACTLY}} one codomain item.  Not 0. Not 2.  Not 3.  Exactly 1!  Thus, when you pick a domain item, you have automatically selected its partner in the codomain.  We could certainly hunt it down inside the codomain.  But, we can also just talk about 


\begin{center}
"\textit{the domain member's partner in the codomain}."  
\end{center}



We have function notation for this thought. \\

\begin{notation} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Function Notation}}  \\

Let \textit{functionName} be the name of a function. \\
Let \textit{d} represent a domain item of \textit{functionName}.

Then, "\textit{functionName}(d)" represents \textit{d}'s partner in the codomain. \\

$(d, functionName(d))$ is a pair in \textit{functionName}. \\


\textit{functionName}(d) is called "the value of functionName \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{AT}} d". \\
\textit{functionName}(d) is pronounced as "functionName \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{OF}} d".
\end{notation}







\begin{example} \textit{SuperBowlWinner}


\textit{SuperBowlWinner}(Superbowl 13) represents the winning team from Superbowl 13, which is the Pittsburgh Steelers.  This equality is communicated with an equation.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{SuperBowlWinner}(Superbowl 13) = Pittsburgh Steelers  
\end{itemize}



The pair (Superbowl 13, \textit{SuperBowlWinner}(Superbowl 13)) is the pair (Superbowl 13, Pittsburgh Steelers). \

\end{example}

\textbf{Note:} The one and only rule for funcitons doesn't refer to the range.

Not every NFL team has won a Superbowl. As of 2020, the Cleveland Browns had not won a Superbowl.  So, there are codomain items that are not partnered with a domain item.  This is not true of the domain.  Every domain item is paired with a codomain item.  That is our one and only function rule.  Every domain item appears in exactly one pair.  But not every codomain item appears in a pair.  This is significant and deserves some language.


\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Range}} \\

The \textbf{range} of a function is the collection of items in the codomain which are paired with some item in the domain.  The range is the collection of function values.
\end{definition}

The range and codomain are separate sets.  The range and codomain could be equal sets or the range could be a proper subset of the codomain. \\

\[  Range \subseteq Codomain\]

\begin{itemize}
\item The Cleveland Browns are not in the range of \textit{SuperBowlWinner}.  
\item The Pittsburgh Steelers are in the range of \textit{SuperBowlWinner}.
\end{itemize}









\begin{example} \textit{AppearedIn}

Let's name the following function \textit{AppearedIn}.

domain = \{ Casablanca, House of Wax,  The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Toy Story, The Fly \}

codomain = \{ Marlon Brando, Vincent Price, Humphrey Bogart, Peter O'Toole, Harrison Ford, Al Pacino \}

pairs = \{ (The Godfather, Marlon Brando), (House of Wax, Vincent Price), (Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart), (Lawrence of Arabia, Peter O'Toole), (The Fly, Vincent Price) \} 





\begin{question}

Is \textit{AppearedIn} well-defined?

\begin{multipleChoice}
	\choice{Yes}
	\choice[correct]{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
Toy Story is in the domain and not in any pair.
\end{feedback}

\end{question}



\end{example}














\begin{example} \textit{AppearedInAgain}

Let's name the following function \textit{AppearedInAgain}.

domain = \{ Casablanca, House of Wax,  The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, The Fly \}

codomain = \{ Marlon Brando, Vincent Price, Humphrey Bogart, Peter O'Toole, Harrison Ford, Al Pacino \}

pairs = \{ (The Godfather, Marlon Brando), (House of Wax, Vincent Price), (Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart), (Lawrence of Arabia, Peter O'Toole), (The Fly, Vincent Price) \} 





\begin{question}

Is \textit{AppearedInAgain} well-defined?

\begin{multipleChoice}
	\choice[correct]{Yes}
	\choice{No}
\end{multipleChoice}
\begin{feedback}
Every domain member is in exactly one pair.
\end{feedback}

\end{question}







\begin{question}

Which codomain items are not in the range of \textit{ActorAgain}?

\begin{selectAll}
	\choice{Marlon Brando}
	\choice{Vincent Price}
	\choice{Humphrey Bogart}
	\choice{Peter O'Toole}
	\choice{Harrison Ford}
	\choice[correct]{Al Pacino}
\end{selectAll}

\end{question}
