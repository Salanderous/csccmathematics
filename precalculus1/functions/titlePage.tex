\section{Anatomy of a Function}


Functions are special relations. While a relation is just two sets of items and some pairings between the two sets, functions satisfy one rule: \\


\begin{condition} \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{THE Rule}}  \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Functions are those relations where each domain item is paired with \underline{exactly} one codomain item.
\end{itemize}
\end{condition}


\begin{center}
\textbf{OR}
\end{center}


\begin{condition} \textbf{\textcolor{purple!85!blue}{THE Rule}} \\

\begin{itemize}
\item Functions are those relations where each domain item occurs in \underline{exactly} one pair.
\end{itemize}
\end{condition}




This simple rule makes a world of difference. But, we can do a little better for this course. \\




This course is a study of measurements and how they compare to each other, which means it is a study of the real numbers.  Therefore, the domains and ranges of our functions will be subsets of the real numbers.  We say that our functions map real numbers to real numbers

\[
\text{ f : } \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}
\]





With the addition of this one rule and the restriction of our domains and codomains to be sets of real numbers, we are ready to begin our journey towards Calculus.
