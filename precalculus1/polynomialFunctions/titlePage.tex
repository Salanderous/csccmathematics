Polynomial functions are our "go to" functions.  They are like decimal numbers.  When you need to approximate a number, you select a decimal expansion with enough digits to give you the accuracy you desire.

When you need to approximate a function, you select a polynomial with enough terms to give you the accuracy your desire. You will do plenty of this in Calculus.

So, we want to know everything about polynomials.
