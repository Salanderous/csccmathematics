Polynomial funcitons are our "go to" functions.  They are like decimal numbers.  When you need to approximate a number, you figure out a decimal expansion.

When you need to approximate a function, you figure out a polynomial expansion. You will do plenty of this in Calculus.

So, we want to know everything about polynomials.
