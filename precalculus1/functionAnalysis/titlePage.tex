\maketitle




Analyzing a function means telling its story, describing all of its features and characteristics.  A complete analysis includes exact information from algebra and global information from graphs.  The algebraic and graphical information should match, which means each can help the other as you think through the analysis.

A complete anlaysis includes the domain and range, zeros, singularities, discontinuities, intervals of continuity, end-behavior, critical numbers, intervals where the function is increasing and decreasing, global maximum and minimums, and local maximums and minimums.

It also includes a nice graph.  Not necessarily an exact graph, but rather a graph that effectiovely communicates the function's story. It should include intercepts, dashed asymptotes, closed and hollow dots, and arrows to help the reader understand the function.  

Remember, you are communicating to other people. Your analysis must be organized, legible, logical, and help the reader understand your thoughts.

The idea is not to be correct.  The idea is to explain to the reader how you know you are correct.
