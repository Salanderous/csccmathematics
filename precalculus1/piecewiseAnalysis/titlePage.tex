When anaylzing a function, we would like to know the function's domain and range; the function's zeros; intervals where the function is increasing and decreasing; maximum and minimum values of the function; discontinuities and intervals of continuity; singularities; and whatthe graph looks like.



As we develop our library of elementary funcyions, we will accumulate infomraiton on these chanracteristics and features of each function.  Currently, our library contains linear and quadratic functions.  

A parallel story line is that of piecewise defined functions.  Gluing pieces of functions together is one of our first methods to create functions beyond our library of elementary functions.

In this section, we will begin to analyze piecewise functions created from pieces and parts of linear and quadratic functions.



















\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item identify discontinuites.
\item identify maximum and minimum values.
\item identify function zeros.
\item state intervals where function is increasing and decreasing.
\item state domains and ranges.
\end{itemize}
