Piecewise functions are defined by using pieces of other functions. Since we are familiar with linbear and quadratic functions, let's build some piece wise functions from their pieces.




\[
V(h) = 
\begin{cases}
  $-2h-3$ & \text{ if } $[-6, -2]$   \\
  $-(h+3)(h-3)$ & \text{ if } $(-2, 4]$  \\
  $2h-5$ & \text{ if } $(4,6)$
\end{cases}
\]



A graph always helps our thinking. Here is thegraph of $y = V(h)$.








\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture} 
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$h$, ylabel=$y$,
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
			\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=100,domain=(-6:-2)] {-2*x-3};
       		\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=100,domain=(-2:4)] {-1*(x+3)*(x-3))};
       		\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=100,domain=(4:8)] {1.75*x-8};




			\addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-6,9)};
			\addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-2,1)};

			\addplot[color=penColor,fill=white,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-2,5)};
			\addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(4,-7)};

			\addplot[color=penColor,fill=white,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(4,-1)};
			\addplot[color=penColor,fill=white,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(8,6)};

\section{Domain and Range} 

From the definition of $V(h)$, we can see the domain in $[-6, 6)$.

Using he graph we can see that the range is $[-7, 9]$.   The low point on the graph is $(4, -7$.  THere are two high points, $-8,9)$ and $(0,9)$.









\section{Continuity} 


Linear and quadratic functions are continuous functions.  Therefore, we only need to check the endpoints of maximal intervals.  Here, those would be $\{ -6, -2, 4, 6 \}$.

From the graph, we can see that 

\begin{itemize}
\item $-6$ is an included endpoint of a maximal interval.  
\item there is a jump discontinuity at $-2$.
\item there is a jump discontinuity at $4$.
\item $6$ is not in the domain.
\end{itemize}


$V(h)$ is continuous on $[-6, -2]$, $(-2, 4]$, and $(4, 6)$.  These correspond to the intervals in the definition of $V(h)$, because there were not isolated points.






\section{Extreme Values} 


We just discovered that the global maximum value of $V$ is $9$ and it occurs at $-8$ and $0$.

We also identified the global minimum as $-7$, which occurs at $4$.


Of course, these global extrema also count as local extrema.  In addition, we have a local minimum of $1$ at $-2$. There are no local maximums.







\section{Monotonic Intervals} 



\begin{itemize}
\item $V$ is decreasing on $[-8,-2]$.
\item $V$ is increasing on $[-8,0]$.
\item $V$ is decreasing on $[0,4]$.
\item $V$ is increasing on $[4,6)$.
\end{itemize}
