We have been examining function characteristics near individual numbers. We have noticed that, for the most part, all of the action happens within some interval.  Action includes zeros, singularities, hills andvalleys in the graph, maximums andm inimums.  $[-10, 10]$  is a very popular interval to investigate, because of technology.  Of course, functions can have zeros outside this interval.  

Perhaps we should be investigating the interval $[-1000, 1000]$, $[-50000, 50000]$, $[-750000, 750000]$, or $[-1000000, 1000000]$. All of our elementary functions have a finite interval which holds all of its interesting places.  Even periodic functions have an interval containing a single wave, which then describes the whole function.

Eventually, outside some interval, the function doesn't do anything.  It settles down into a simple pattern.  We call this eventual pattern the \textbf{end-behavior}.



What are the simple patterns on $(-\infty, a) \cup (a, \infty)$?  Where $a$ is "big enough".
