Eventually, outside some interval, the function doesn't do anything.  It settles down into a simple pattern.  We call this eventual pattern the \textbf{end-behavior}.



What are the simple patterns on $(-\infty, a) \cup (a, \infty)$?  Where $a$ is "big enough".  What does "big enough" mean?




\begin{example} big enough





Compare the graphs of $y = f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(3x-2)(x+5)(x+3)$ and $y=g(x) = \frac{3}{2}x^3$.

These two functions are either completely different or almost the same.  It depends on your viewpoint.

Inside $[-10, 10]$, they behave much differently. Their zeros are different.  $f(x)$ has local maximums and minimums.  Its graph has hills and valleys.  $g(x)$ is always increasing.

However, if you change your view point to $(-\infty, -50) \cup (50, \infty)$, then they are almost identical.



We would say $g(x) = \frac{3}{2}x^3$ is the end-behavior of $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(3x-2)(x+5)(x+3)$.
