Composition is an operation on functions.  It takes two functions and produces a third function.


\[  (Outside \circ Inside)(d) = Outside(Inside(d))    \]


For our transformation story, we have a function, $f(x)$, and we would like to transform vertically.  In a previous section, that has looked like


\[   a \, f(x) + b  \]


We can view this as a composition:


\[  \text{Let } \, L(x) = a \, x + b   \]


\[   a \, f(x) + b  = (L \circ f)(x)\]



Our vertical graphical transformations can be viewed as a composition with a linear function.
