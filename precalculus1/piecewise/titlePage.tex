The goal of this course is to become familiar with the \textit{Elementary Functions}. These are our basic building blocks.  We will examine their formulas and graphs.  We will identify important features of each type. We will measure their rates of change. 

From these building blocks we build some very sophisticated and complex functions through the usual arithmetic operations and new operation called \textit{composition}. 

Separate from that type of combination, we also create new functions by cutting the Elementary Functions into pieces and gluing them together into odd shapes.   These are called \textbf{piecewise defined} functions.  Piecewise defined functions are especially handy for illustrating the rich and weird structure of functions.
