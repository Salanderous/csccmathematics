We have two different thoughts about functions.


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Numbers:}  Functions are constructed from individual pairs of individual numbers.  When we evaluate functions, we think of each point one at a time.  The graphs of functions are indiviudal points plotted to represent the pairs. 







$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Intervals:} As we examine functions, we notice patterns, which we call behavior. We naturally group many pairs together where the function hsa similar behavior.  Collecting points forms intervals and we begin thinking in terms of intervals.





In particular, we calculate rate of change over intervals. 


However, intervals are just collections of individual numbers.  Is there a way to translate this rate of change idea down to single numbers?

The answer is yes.  We will begin this thought here with quadratic functions. We'll extend this thought a bit throughout the course. Then Calculus will answer the question fully with the derivative.
