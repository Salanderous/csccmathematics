\maketitle
















We have \textbf{operations} for our numbers.  Operations usually take two numbers and exchange them for a third number.

\begin{center}
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, etc.
\end{center}



Just like numbers, functions have an arithmetic.  They have all of the usual number operations, plus one more.  Functions also have an operation called \textbf{composition}.  Composition takes two functions and exchanges them for a third function.

Just like number operations have an identity number, $0$ and $1$, composition has an identiy function - the identity function: $Id(x) = x$.


\begin{itemize}
\item Adding $0$ with numbers appears to do nothing.
\item Multiplying $1$ with numbers appears to do nothing.
\item Composing $Id$ with functions appears to do nothing.
\end{itemize}
