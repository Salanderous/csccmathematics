With the caveat that domains need to be aligned, we have many operations on functions that make up an arithmetic on functions.




$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Addition} 

The sum of two functions is again a function. The inverse of addition is subtracton. 

The additive identity is $Zero(x) = 0$ for all real numbers.




$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Mulitplication} 

The product of two functions is again a function. The inverse of mulitplication is division. 

The mulitplicative identity is $One(x) = 1$ for all real numbers.



$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Composition} 

Composition is a new operation on functions.

The composition of two functions again a function. 

The identity function, $I(x) = x$ for all $x$, is the identity element with respect to composition.



\[   f \circ I = f    \, \text{ and } \, I \circ f = f        \]



The inverse of $f$ with respect to composition is another function whose composition with $f$ produces the identity function.

The symbol for the inverse of $f$ is $f^{-1}$.

\[   f \circ f^{-1} = I    \, \text{ and } \, f^{-1} \circ f = I       \]










\begin{example} Composition


\begin{itemize}
\item Let $K(u) = \frac{u}{u-1}$ with its implied domain: $(-\infty, 1) \cup (1. \infty)$. \\

\item Let $T(w) = w^2 + 5w + 7$ with its implied domain: \textbf{$\mathbb{R}$}.
\end{itemize}


Form the composition $K \circ T$.

\[        (K \circ T)(w) =     \frac{w^2 + 5w + 7}{(w^2 + 5w + 7)-1}   =    \frac{w^2 + 5w + 7}{w^2 + 5w + 6}  \]


$K$ can accept any number, except $1$.  Therefore we need to find out when $T = 1$ and take out the domain numbers where $1$ occurs.



\begin{align*}
T(w) & = 1   \\
w^2 + 5w + 7 & = 1 \\
w^2 + 5w + 6 & = 0   \\
(w+2)(w+3) & = 0
\end{align*}


We need to remove $-2$ and $-3$ from the domain of $T$, because $T(-2)=1$ and $T(-3)=1$ and $1$ cannot be an input into $K$.


The domain for $K \circ T$ is $(-\infty, -3) \cup (-3, -2) \cup (-2, \infty)$




\[        (K \circ T)(w)  =    \frac{w^2 + 5w + 7}{w^2 + 5w + 6}  =    \frac{w^2 + 5w + 7}{(w+2)(w+3)} \]










The composition produces a function. \\


This is a good reminder that a formula is not a function.  In the case of a composition, we need to restrict the domain of the inner function to avoid inner function values that are not in the domain of the outer function.
