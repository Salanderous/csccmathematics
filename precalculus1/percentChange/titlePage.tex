The defining characteristic of linear functions is that the have a constant growth rate.


\[   \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = m       \]

This led to the equation or formula for linear functions:  $f(x) = m(x-a) + f(a)$


This tells us that no matter where you are in the domain, of $f$, if you move a distance of $1$, the value of $f$ increases by $m$. \\


Exponential functions don't do that. \\









The general template for an exponential function is 

\[   exp(t) = a \, b^t   \, \text{ where } \,  a \ne 0  \, \text{ and } \,    b > 0   \]



Their defining characteristic is a constant percentage growth rate.
