We have seen that given an exponential function, we can reverse the pairs and get a logarithmic function.  If the pairs of the exponential function look like $(D,R)$, then the pairs of the logarithmic funciton lok like $(R,D)$.  The same numbers are pairded together.  The just swap their roles between domain and range.

\section{Composition}

What if we were to compose these two functions?  That is we make a new function where by take a domain number for the exponential function, get the function value, and then take this function value as the input into the logarithmic funciton, and get is output. \\





\textbf{Setup}

We have two partnered exponential and logarithmic functions: $E(x)$ and $L(t)$.  \\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $d$ be a domain number of $E(x)$.
\item $d$ is in a pair: $(d, r)$.
\item The value of $E(d)$ is $r$.
\item View $r$ as a number in the domain of $L(t)$.
\item We already know that $(r,d)$ is a pair in $L(x)$, because $E$ and $L$ are partnered.  Their pairs are reversed.
\item That tell us that $L(r)=d$
\end{enumerate}


The composition $L \circ E$ pairs $d$ with itself: $(d,d)$ for all of the domain numbers. \\



\[   (L \circ E)(x) = x        \]




\begin{example}  Composition

We have seen that $E(x) = -2 \,log_3(4-x)$ and $L(t) = 4 - 3^{-\frac{t}{2}}$ are two partnered exponential and logarithmic functions. \\


Let $d$ be in the domain of $E(x)$, then $E(d) = -2 \,log_3(4-d)$. \\

Now, let's put this number into $L$. \\



\[    (L \circ E)(d)  =  L(-2 \,log_3(4-d)) = 4 - 3^{-\frac{-2 \,log_3(4-d)}{2}}              \]


\[    (L \circ E)(d)  =  4 - 3^{log_3(4-d)}              \]


\[    (L \circ E)(d)  =  4 - (4-d)             \]


\[    (L \circ E)(d)  = d             \]


\end{example}




Let's try it the other way.










\begin{example}  Composition

We have seen that $E(x) = -2 \,log_3(4-x)$ and $L(t) = 4 - 3^{-\frac{t}{2}}$ are two partnered exponential and logarithmic functions. \\


Let $d$ be in the domain of $L(t)$, then $L(d) = 4 - 3^{-\frac{d}{2}}$. \\

Now, let's put this number into $E$. \\



\[    (E \circ L)(d)  =  E(4 - 3^{-\frac{d}{2}}) = -2 \,log_3(4 - (4 - 3^{-\frac{d}{2}}))            \]


\[    (E \circ L)(d)  =  -2 \,log_3( 3^{-\frac{d}{2}})              \]


\[    (E \circ L)(d)  = -2 \, \left(-\frac{d}{2}\right)              \]


\[    (E \circ L)(d)  = d            \]


\end{example}
