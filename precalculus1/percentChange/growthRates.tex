$\blacktriangleright$ Linear Functions \\


\begin{quote}
The defining characteristic of linear functions is that the have a constant growth rate.
\end{quote}





\[   \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = m       \]

This led to the formula for linear functions:  $f(x) = m(x-a) + f(a)$


This tells us that no matter where you are in the domain, of $f$, if you move the same distance, then the value of $f$ increases by same \textbf{amount}. \\


Exponential functions don't do that. \\



$\blacktriangleright$ Exponential Functions \\



Suppose we have is a function with this property:  No mater where you are in the domain, if you move the same amount in the domain, then function value changes by the same percent.  Then what does the formula look like?



\begin{itemize}
\item Let's call our function $E$.
\item Let's call our original position in the domain, $a$.
\item Let's call the distance moved from $a$, $d$.
\item Let's say the percentage increase is $p \cdot 100\%$. 
\end{itemize}



From this infomration, the starting function value is $E(a)$ and the finishing function value is $E(a+d)$.  Therefore, the increase in function value is given by $E(a+d) - E(a)$.

We also know that this increase is equal to $p$ percentage of the original value $E(a)$.



\[
E(a+d) - E(a) = p E(a)
\]

\[
E(a+d) = E(a) (1+p)
\]

If we travel another $d$, then we get


\[
E(a + 2d) = E(a)(1+p) \cdot (1+p) = E(a) (1+p)^2
\]


If we travel another $d$, then we get


\[
E(a + 3d) = E(a)(1+p)^2 \cdot (1+p) = E(a) (1+p)^3
\]



If we travel "$x$" number of distances, $d$, from $a$, then we get

\[
E(a + 3x \cdot d) = E(a)(1+p)^x 
\]

An exponential function.



\begin{definition}
\textbf{Exponential functions} are those functions that experience a constant percentage growth rate. \\


Their formulas look like

\[
exp(x) = a \cdot b^x
\]


where $a \ne 0$ and $b > 0$.

$a$ is called the \textbf{coefficient} and $b$ is called the \textbf{base}.

\end{definition}

















\begin{fact}  No Constant Growth



Exponential functions do not have a constant growth rate. \\


Let $G(t) = 5 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^t$ with domain \textbf{$R$}. 






\begin{itemize}
\item $G(0) = 5$
\item $G(1) = \frac{15}{2}$
\item $G(2) = \frac{45}{4}$
\end{itemize}



Each time we moved $1$ in the domain, $G(t)$ DID NOT increase by the same amount.

$G(1) - G(0) = \answer{\frac{5}{2}}$ \\

$G(2) - G(1) = \answer{\frac{15}{4}}$ \\

$ \frac{5}{2}  \ne  \frac{15}{4} $, therefore $G(t)$ does not have a constant rate-of-change. \\

\end{fact}




Instead, $G$ has a constant percentage rate-of-change. \\

No matter where you are in the domain, when you move $1$, the value of $G$ increases by the same percentage (is multiplied by the same factor).


Let $a$ be a real number.  The percentage rate-of-change of $G$ over the interval $[a,a+1]$ is 



\[    \frac{5 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{a+1} - 5 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^a}{5 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^a}       \]


\[   \frac{5 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^a (\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) - 1) }{5 \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^a}    \]


\[   \left(\frac{3}{2}\right) - 1 = \frac{1}{2}   \]

Every time we move $1$ in the domain, $G$ increases by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$.  $G$ increases by $50\%$.





The general template for an exponential function is 

\[   exp(t) = a \, b^t   \, \text{ where } \,  a \ne 0  \, \text{ and } \,    b > 0   \]



\begin{example} Percentage Change



Let $H(t) = 3 \, \cdot \, 2^t$ \\

$H$ is an exponential function, which means it has a constant percentage change. \\

Values of $H$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $H(0) = \answer{3}$

\item $H(1) = \answer{6}$

\item $H(2) = \answer{12}$
\end{itemize}



Change in $H$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $H(1) - H(0) = \answer{3}$

\item $H(2) - H(1) = \answer{12}$

\end{itemize}





Percentage change in $H$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{H(1) - H(0)}{H(0)} = \answer{1}$, which is $\answer{100}\%$

\item $\frac{H(2) - H(1)}{H(1)} = \answer{1}$, which is $\answer{100}\%$

\end{itemize}






\end{example}



Every time $t$ increases by $1$, the value of $H$ gets multiplied by another $2$, which means its value is doubled, which means it \textbf{changes} by its current value, which means it grows by $100\%$.











\begin{example} Percentage Change



Let $k(x) = 5 \, \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^x$ \\

$k$ is an exponential function, which means it has a constant percentage change. \\

Values of $k$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $k(0) = \answer{5}$

\item $k(1) = \answer{\frac{15}{4}}$

\item $k(2) = \answer{\frac{45}{16}}$
\end{itemize}



Change in $k$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $k(1) - k(0) = \answer{-\frac{5}{4}}$

\item $k(2) - k(1) = \answer{-\frac{15}{16}}$

\end{itemize}





Percentage change in $k$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{k(1) - k(0)}{k(0)} = \answer{-\frac{1}{4}}$, which is $\answer{-25}\%$

\item $\frac{k(2) - k(1)}{k(1)} = \answer{-\frac{1}{4}}$, which is $\answer{-25}\%$

\end{itemize}






\end{example}

Every time $x$ increases by $1$, the value of $k$ gets multiplied by another $\frac{3}{4}$, which means its value decreases. It loses $\frac{1}{4}$ of its value. It has a negative growth rate. It grows by $-25\%$.








\section{A New Number: e}


Consider this function 

\[
e(x) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x
\]



Here is a graph


\begin{center}
\desmos{0tuazdb3kc}{400}{300}
\end{center}


The graph of this function has a horizontal asymptote.  The horizontal asymptote intersects the $y$-axis at a number.  This number is called $e$.   It is a special number and gets its own symbol, much like $\pi$ gets its own symbol.



\[
e \approx  2.718281828459045235360287471352662497757247093699959574966967627724076630353547594571382178525166427
\]


$e$ is an irrational number that has many connections to natural growth.  $e$ its importance will show up in Calculus.



















\begin{example} Percentage Change



Let $p(x) = 3 \, e^x$ \\

$p$ is an exponential funciton, which means it has a constant percentage change. \\

Values of $p$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $p(0) = 3$

\item $p(1) = 3 e$

\item $p(2) = 3 e^2$
\end{itemize}



Change in $p$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $p(1) - p(0) = 3 (e-1)$

\item $p(2) - p(1) = 3 e (e-1)$

\end{itemize}





Percentage change in $p$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{p(1) - p(0)}{p(0)} = e - 1$, which is about $171.8\%$

\item $\frac{p(2) - p(1)}{p(1)} = e-1 $, which is about $171.8\%$

\end{itemize}


\end{example}


















\begin{example} Percentage Change



Let $R(t) = a \, r^t$, with $a$ and $r$ real numbers and $r>0$ \\

$R$ is an exponential function, which means it has a constant percentage change. \\

Values of $R$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $R(0) = a$

\item $R(1) = a \, r$

\item $R(2) = a \, r^2$
\end{itemize}



Change in $R$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $R(1) - R(0) = \answer{a (r-1)}$

\item $R(2) - R(1) = \answer{a r (r-1)}$

\end{itemize}





Percentage change in $R$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\frac{R(1) - R(0)}{R(0)} = \answer{r-1}$

\item $\frac{R(2) - R(1)}{R(1)} = \answer{r-1}$
