pairs to dots

\maketitle


Function notation allows us to talk about individual pairs inside a function.


\[
\large{ (d, F(d))}
\]

$d$ is sitting in the left position of our ordered pair, therefore it represents a domain number. $F(d)$ represents the value of the function at $d$ and is written on the right in the ordered pair.


\begin{example}
SUppose 4 is a member of the domain of the function $H$. Then $H(4)$ represents the value of $H$ at $4$. $H(4)$ is a member of the range of $H$. $(4, H(4))$ is a pair in the function $H$.

If we happen to know that $(4, 9)$ is a pair in the funciton $H$, then we know $H(4) = 9$.

\end{example}


Aside from talking about individual pairs, we might also like to talk about the whole collection at once.  Our first attempt at this is via pictures. We need a way to visually represent a single pair and then convert all pairs to a picture.  With this picture, we can analyze the function as a whole, identify important places in the domain, detect trands in the data, quick estimate information about the whole function.
