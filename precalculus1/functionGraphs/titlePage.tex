Functions are relations, which makes them packages.  They contain three sets.  They contain a set of real numbers called the \textbf{domain}.  They contain a second set of real numbers called the \textbf{range}. Finally, they contain a third set of pairs of numbers.  The pairs are all constructed with a number from each of the domain and range.

The pairs are the point of the function.  The pairs are the connections between the domain and range numbers.  They identify which numbers are associated together from both sets. In a function, each domain number is in exactly one pair.

We can talk about these pairs one by one with \textbf{function notation}.

\[
\large{F(d)}
\]


$F$ is the name of the function and $d$ is a domain number.  $F(d)$ represents the range partner of $d$.  $d$ and $F(d)$ are partnered together in $F$.

When we write down such a pairing, we usually write  the domain number on the left and the range partner (or function value) on the right, separated by a comma, and wrapped with parentheses.

\[ 
\large{(d, F(d))} 
\]

Independent of this, we might actually have an expression for this range partner, say $r$.  We can communicate this with an equation


\[
\large{F(d) = r}
\]


\section{See the Whole Picture}

Aside from talking about individual pairs, we might also like to talk about the whole collection at once.  Our first attempt at this is via pictures. We need a way to visually represent a single pair and then convert all pairs to a picture.  With this picture, we can analyze the function as a whole, identify important places in the domain, detect trends in the data, and quickly estimate information about the whole function.
