Since sine and cosine are periodic, our analysis often focuses on the interval $[0, 2\pi)$ and then reasons the remaining information from the periodicity.  \\

\begin{itemize}
\item On $[0, 2\pi)$, the maximum of $\cos(\theta)$ occurs at $\answer{0}$. 
\item On $[0, 2\pi)$, the minimum of $\cos(\theta)$ occurs at $\answer{\pi}$. 
\end{itemize}





If we shift the domain of $\cos(\theta)$, then the minimum and maximum should follow the shift. \\




\begin{question} Shifted Domain 

Define $W(m) = \cos\left(m - \frac{\pi}{6} \right)$. \\




Which interval would we focus on when analyzing $W(m)$? \\

\[
\left[      \answer{\frac{\pi}{6}},   \answer{\frac{7\pi}{6}}     \right)
\]




Where does the maximum of $W(m)$ occur?

\[
m = \answer{\frac{\pi}{6}} 
\]





Where does the minimum of $W(m)$ occur?

\[
m = \answer{\frac{7\pi}{6}} 
\]



\end{question}
