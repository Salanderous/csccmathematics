Since sine and cosine are periodic, our analysis often focuses on the interval $[0, 2\pi)$ and then reasons the remaining information from the periodicity.  \\

\begin{itemize}
\item On $[0, 2\pi)$, the maximum of $\sin(\theta)$ occurs at $\answer{\frac{\pi}{2}}$. 
\item On $[0, 2\pi)$, the minimum of $\sin(\theta)$ occurs at $\answer{\frac{3\pi}{2}}$. 
\end{itemize}










\begin{question} Shifted Domain 

Define $f(t) = \sin\left(t + \frac{\pi}{3} \right)$. \\




Which interval would we focus on when analyzing $f(t)$? \\

\[
\left[      \answer{-\frac{\pi}{3}},   \answer{\frac{5\pi}{3}}     \right)
\]




Where does the maximum of $f(t)$ occur?

\[
t = \answer{\frac{\pi}{6}} 
\]





Where does the minimum of $f(t)$ occur?

\[
t = \answer{\frac{7\pi}{6}} 
\]



\end{question}
