Many new functions are created from known functions.


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Arithmetic:} A new function can be created as the sum, difference, product, or quotient of two known functions. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Piecewise:} A new function can be created by gluing together pieces of other functions.  We introduced the idea of piecewise defined functions earlier. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Shifting:}  A function is essentially a collection of domain-range pairs.  


\begin{itemize}
\item We can simply shift the domain numbers in the pairs to create a new function.
\item We can simply shift the range numbers in the pairs to create a new function.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Expectations}


\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item examine the effects of shifting a domain.
\item examine the effects of shifting a range.
\end{itemize}
