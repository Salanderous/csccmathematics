We have already seen a couple of versions of composition.

$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Pointwise} composition was seen via indiviudal numbers: $(F \circ G)(a) = F(G(a))$.

A number, $a$, in the domain of $G$ was connected to its range partner, $G(a)$.  $G$ was evaluated at $a$ and the function value was then viewed as a member of the domain of $F$.  As a member of the domain of $F$, $F$ can be evaluated at $G(a)$ to get $F(G(a))$.




$\blacktriangleright$ \textbf{Linear} composition between twi linear functions produced a whole new function.  Instead of thinking of domain numbers indiviudally, this composition was viewed as an operation on linear functions.

\[    (L_o \circ L_i)(x) = L_o(L_i(x))  \]

There is an outside function, $L_o(x)$, and an inside function $L_i(x)$.  The composition operation, $\circ$, is applied and a new linear funciton is created.  Our symbol for this number funciton is $(L_o \circ L_i)$ or $L_o \circ L_i$.  The parentheses are used to clear up communication.

In our investigations, we have discovered that $(L_o \circ L_i)$ "is" $L_o$, just shifted, stretched, and reflected horizontally.


We would like to extend this idea of a function operation beyond linear functions.





\section{Composition}





\begin{definition} Composition


Given two functions, $Outside$ and $Inside$, the composition, $Outside \circ Inside$ is defined by

\[      (Outside \circ Inside)(a) = Outside(Inside(a))        \]

For $ a \in \{  x \in Dom_{Inside} \, | \,    Inside(x) \in Dom_{Outside}  \}$

\end{definition}



We have to do a little work on the domain.  We need the elements from the domain of the inside function, whose function value lands inside the domain of hte outside function. \\





$\star$ \textbf{\textcolor{purple}{Inside = Linear}}


In this section, our inside funciton will always be a linear function.



\[      (Outside \circ L)(a) = Outside(L(a))        \]


where $L(x) = a \, x + b$, with $a$ and $b$ real numbers and $a \ne 0$.



Let's consider a quadratic function: $Q(h) = (h+1)(h-4)$

          ]
          
            
      		\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(-2.5:5.5),<->] {(x+1)*(x-4)};

We can consider $Q(h)$ as a composition.  The outside function is $Q(h) = (h+1)(h-4)$ and hte inside function is the Identity function: $I(h)=h$.  

The inside function doesn't do much.  It pairs every real number with itself.  Then this is handed to $H$. Not much of a composition, but it will help us illustrate some ideas.



The domain of $I(h)=h$ is \textbf{$\mathbb{R}$}.  We can think of moving along the real line left to right from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.  Each real number we run across is put into $I(h)$, which just gives it right back and also runs along the real line left to right from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.  This then becomes the domain for the outside function, $Q(h)$.



$\blacktriangleright$  What happens when we have a different inside function?


Suppose $inside(h) = 5h$.


$inside(h)$ still runs along the real line left to right from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. What's the difference?

The difference is that the identity function ran across it s domain and the output was running from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ at exactly the same rate - because the input and out were equal - it is the identity function.


Now the range is running through the real line left to right from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ - four times as fast as the input. A little movement in the domain results in a lot of movement in the range and this range is the domain for $Q(h)$.


$Q(h)$ has a zero at $-1$ and at $4$.  That is a distance of $4$. The domain of $Q(h)$ needs to run this distance of $5$ from $-1$ to $4$ to get from one zero to the other.


That means the range of $inside(h)$ must run from  $-1$ to $4$ to get from one zero to the other, since the range of $inside(h)$ is the domain of $Q(h)$.

Which brings us to the domain of $inside(h)$, for our composition. 

It doesn't need to run that distance of $5$, because its movement gets amplified by a factor of $5$ through the $inside$ function.  The domain of $inside$ needs to run from $-\frac{1}{5}$ to $\frac{4}{5}$ - a distance of $1$




\begin{itemize}
\item $(Q \circ inside)\left(-\frac{1}{5}\right) = Q\left(inside\left(-\frac{1}{5}\right)\right) = Q(-1) = 0$
\item $(Q \circ inside)\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) = Q\left(inside\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\right) = Q(4) = 0$
\end{itemize}


In the $(Q \circ inside)$ function, the zeros are at $-\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{4}{5}$.  They are a distance of $1$ apart.  The $inside$ function has squeezed them closer together by making its range run faster than it domain - and that range became a new faster running domain for $Q$.

            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,

            xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            yticklabels={$-10$,$-8$,$-6$,$-4$,$-2$,$2$,$4$,$6$,$8$,$10$}, 
            xticklabels={$-10$,$-8$,$-6$,$-4$,$-2$,$2$,$4$,$6$,$8$,$10$},

            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
            
      		\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(-0.5:1.1),<->] {(5*x+1)*(5*x-4)};

All of the Q values are still there.  The output of $Q \circ inside$ are the same values of $Q$.  They are just connected to faster running domain values then before.
