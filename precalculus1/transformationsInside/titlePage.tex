Composition is an operation on functions.  It takes two functions and produces a third function.


\[  (Outside \circ Inside)(d) = Outside(Inside(d))    \]


The values of the $Inside$ function are elements of the domain of the Outside function. Normally, we think of running along the real line and these domain numbers are connected with their $Outside$ function value.  It is a very orderly process.

Now the $Inside$ will be providing the domain numbers to the $Outside$ function and it may not be orderly. The values of the $Inside$ function may increase and decrease, which, in turn, means the domain numbers for $Outside$ may get repeated or run backwards.

In this section, the $Inside$ function is a linear function.  This will change the rate or speed of the domain for $Outside$, but it won't do anythign exotic.  We'll leave that for a later section.
