\begin{example}  Common Factor


Solve $\sqrt{x+9} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (x+9)^{-\tfrac{1}{2}} > 0$



\textbf{\textcolor{purple!50!blue!90!black}{SOLUTION}}




\begin{observation} Quick Analysis


The square root function is never negative.  Therefore, for $x > 0$ each of the terms would be positive.  So, at least this inequality has $(0, \infty)$ in the solution set.  \\


The domain of the square root function is nonnegative numbers.  Therefore, the interval $(-\infty, -9)$ is not in the solution set.   \\


$x \ne -9$, because the negative exponent means that factor is in the denominator.

\end{observation}



If we look at the graph of  

\[
y = f(x) = \sqrt{x+9} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (x+9)^{-\tfrac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{x+9} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x+9}} 
\]

It appears that the solution set is something like  $(-6, \infty)$, which would agree with out quick analysis.  We need algebra to get the exact value of the left endpoint (looking at the graph is not enough).


This left endpoint of this domain interval is a zero of $f(x)$ \\ 






A common factor is a factor of the least degree in all of the terms.  We have one here. $(x+9)$ is a factor in both terms.  The powers are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$. The least of which is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

We will use the distributive property to factor out $(x+9)^{\answer{-\tfrac{1}{2}}}$.


$(x+9)^{-\tfrac{1}{2}} \left((x+9) + x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)  = 0$


We could, in turn, write this as a fraction


$\frac{\left((x+9) + x \cdot \frac{1}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{x+9}} = 0$


$\frac{ \frac{3}{2} x + 9}{\sqrt{x+9}} = 0$



This is a fraction, so it equals $0$ when the numerator equals $0$ and the denominator does not equal $0$.


$\answer{\frac{3}{2} x + 9} = 0$



$x = 6$, which is in the domain of $\sqrt{x+9} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (x+9)^{-\tfrac{1}{2}}$.



The solution to the original inequality is $(-6, \infty)$

\begin{example}  Common Factor


Solve $\frac{x^3 (18x) - 9(x^2-3)(3x^2)}{(x^3)^2} = 0$



\textbf{\textcolor{purple!50!blue!90!black}{SOLUTION}}


The numerator is a difference of two terms and $9 x^2$ is a common factor.  We can use the Distributive Property to factor it out.



$\frac{9x^2 (2x^2 - 3(x^2-3))}{x^6} = 0$


$\frac{9 \left( \answer{9 - x^2} \right)}{x^4} = 0$



This is a fraction, so it equals $0$ when the numerator equals $0$ and the denominator does not equal $0$.


$9 - x^2 = 0$

This has two solutions: $\{ -3, 3  \}$, both of which are in the domain.








\end{example}

















\begin{example}  Common Factor


Solve $12 x^3 - 12 x^2 = 0$



\textbf{\textcolor{purple!50!blue!90!black}{SOLUTION}}


The Distributive Property gives us the product $12 x^2 (x-1)$.




We have two solutions: $\{ 0, 1  \}$, both of which are in the domain.



\end{example}





















\begin{example}  Fractions


Solve $2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{x}} = 0$



\textbf{\textcolor{purple!50!blue!90!black}{SOLUTION}}


Converting to exponents gives us $2 - \frac{2}{x^{\tfrac{1}{3}}} = 0$


$2 = \frac{2}{x^{\tfrac{1}{3}}}$

The only way this can happen is if $x^{\tfrac{1}{3}} = \answer{1}$.

This has one solution: $\{  1  \}$
