A major goal of function analysis is to measure how function values are changing - identify where functions are increasing and decreasing.

We would also like to measure this change and compare it to other functions.


Introduced earlier, the derivative provides this rate-of-change information.  We have also hinted that functions switch between increasing and decreasing where the derivative equals $0$.

This reaosning alone is a huge motivation for locating zeros of functions.
