Consider the function $k(t) = t \sqrt{5-t}$ with its natural or implied domain.

Here is the graph of $y = k(t)$.








\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$t$, ylabel=$y$, grid = major,
            ytick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]

\end{image}





We can see that $k(t)$ increases on $(-\infty, c]$ and then decreases on $[c,\infty)$, where $c$ is a real number around $3$.

All of the tangent lines at $(a, k(a))$, where $a \in (-\infty, c)$ have \wordChoice{\choice[correct]{positive} \choice{negative}}  slopes, which means $k'(a) > 0$. \\

All of the tangent lines at $(a, k(a))$, where $a \in (-c, \infty)$ have \wordChoice{\choice{positive} \choice[correct]{negative}}  slopes, which means $k'(a) < 0$. \\

The highest point on the graph has a horizontal tangent line, which has a slope of $\answer{0}$. $k'(t)$ will be $\answer{0}$ at the domain number corresponding to this highest point.


(You don't know how to get the formula for the derivative yet.  That is a topic for Calculus.)


\[   k'(t) = \sqrt{5-t} + t \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{5-t}}    \]


We are looking for a number around $3$, such that 


\[   k'(t) = \sqrt{5-t} + t \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{5-t}}  = 0  \]

We have a common factor of $5-t$.  The least power is $-\frac{1}{2}$.  We use the distributive property to factor this out.


\[  \frac{1}{\sqrt{5-t}} \left( (5-t) - \frac{t}{2} \right) = 0  \]




We need 


\[  \left( (5-t) - \frac{t}{2} \right) = 0  \]

\[  5 - \frac{3t}{2}  = 0  \]


\[  t = \answer{\frac{10}{3}}  \]





We can see that $k(t)$ increases on $\left(-\infty, \frac{10}{3}\right]$ and then decreases on $\left[\frac{10}{3},\infty\right)$.









Places in the domain of $f$, where $f' = 0$ are critically important to function analysis. The function switches its type of growth at these numbers.  Thet are called \textbf{critical numbers}.

Functions can also change their growth across other weird places - like spikes and corners and discontinuities.  The graph will not have a tangent line at the corresponding points. And, $f'$ will not have a value.




Therfore, we are collecting all of these types of domain numbers and calling them \textbf{critical numbers}.





\section{Critical Numbers}




\begin{definition} 

$c \in Dom_f$ is a \textbf{critical number} if  either $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ doesn't exist.


\end{definition}


\textbf{Note:}  Sometimes these are called \textbf{critical points}, especially when you investigate multi-variate functions.  But, are just getting started.  So, we are trying to separate \textit{numbers} in the domain from \textit{points} on the graph. \\


\textbf{Note:} You will learn how to get formulas for derivatives in Calculus.  In this course, you will be given the derivative formlua, when needed. \\















\begin{example}

Consider the function $H(v) = 0.1(v+6)(v+1)(v-4)$.

Here is the graph of $y = H(v)$.








\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$v$, ylabel=$y$, grid = major,
            ytick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
            ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          

			\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(-7:5),<->] {0.1*(x+6)*(x+1)*(x-4)};


			%\addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(5,0)};
           

  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}




We can see that $H(v)$ increases, then decreases, then increases.  


The derivative is $H'(v) = 0.3 v^2 + 0.6 v - 2.2$. \\

Let's clean that up a bit, by factoring out $0.1$. $H'(v) = 0.1 \left( \answer{3 v^2 + 6 v - 22} \right)$. \\



The critical numbers are when $H'(v) = 0.1(3 v^2 + 6 v - 22) =0$ or when $3 v^2 + 6 v - 22 =0$,   a quadratic. \\


The only factors of $22$ are $\{ 1, 2, 11, 22    \}$.  None of those (or their negatives) are adding up to $6$.  So, we will use the quadratic formula.



\[  v = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-22)}}{2 \cdot 3}  = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{300}}{6}    \]


\[  v = \frac{-6 \pm 10\sqrt{3}}{6}  =  \frac{-3 \pm 5\sqrt{3}}{3} \]



We have two solutions


\[  v =  \frac{-3 + 5\sqrt{3}}{3}  \approx  \answer[tolerance=0.01]{1.887} \]


\[  v =  \frac{-3 - 5\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx   \answer[tolerance=0.01]{-3.887} \]




The approximations are to give us an idea of the size of the numbers. However, always prefer to quote the exact value.

\begin{itemize}
\item $H(v)$ increases on $\left( -\infty, \answer{\frac{-3 - 5\sqrt{3}}{3}}   \right]$.
\item $H(v)$ decreases on $\left[ \frac{-3 - 5\sqrt{3}}{3} , \frac{-3 + 5\sqrt{3}}{3}   \right]$.
\item $H(v)$ increases on $\left[ \answer{\frac{-3 + 5\sqrt{3}}{3}}, \infty  \right)$.
\end{itemize}



\end{example}





Isn't $1.887$ good enough?  \textbf{NO!}  

What about $1.886751346$? \textbf{NO!}  

What about $1.886751345948128822545743902509787278238008756350634380093$? \textbf{NO!}  

We want to be exact, when we can be exact.  That is why we are bring our Algebra tools with us.  Otherwise, we would just use graphs all of the time.

$\blacktriangleright$ Our goal is to be precise with our descriptions of functions.


We will encounter many functions whose graphs are misleading - because they have no choice but to be inaccurate.

$\blacktriangleright$ We want our descriptions to be exact and offer nothing to question.
