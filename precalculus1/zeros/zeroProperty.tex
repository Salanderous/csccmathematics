Locating the zeros of a function is an important skill.  Functions switch signs at zeros which can reflect a lot of important information.

We don't have many ways of locating zeros for complicated functions.


$\blacktriangleright$ Zeros of linear functions are easy to locate - just solve the equation for the variable. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ Basic exponential functions don't have zeros.  Basic Logarthmic functions have a zero when the inside of hte formula equals $1$. For more complicated exponential and logarithmic functions, we can use transformations and the algebra rules. \\

$\blacktriangleright$ Sine and Cosine have repeating zeros. So, we can memorize them for one wave and then use transformations to locate the others. \\

$\blacktriangleright$ We have several methods for Quadratic functions.  We can complete the square and use the quadratic formula. \\

That's about it. \\

We have only one more method.  It is specifc and yet mysterious at the same time.



\begin{center}
Write the expression as a product (factor) and use the Zero Product Property of real numbers.
\end{center}



Almost everything we do relies on the Zero Product Property of real numbers. \\


\begin{definition} Zero Product Property

Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers. \\

If $a \cdot b = 0$, then either $a=0$ or $b=0$.


\end{definition}



That is our best tool for locating zeros of functions. \\



\begin{example} Factoring

Solve $k^2 - k - 20 = 0$ \\

\textbf{\textcolor{purple!50!blue!90!black}{SOLUTION}} \\



Rewrite $k^2 - k - 20$ as a product.

If $k^2 - k - 20 = (factor) \cdot (factor)$, then the factors will have to be linear.

Therefore we can begin with a template like, $k^2 - k - 20 = (k + ?) \cdot (k + ?)$

When we multiply the factors out, the product of the two constant terms will have to be $-20$.

Possibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item $-20 \cdot 1$
\item $20 \cdot -1$
\item $-10 \cdot 2$
\item $10 \cdot -2$
\item $-5 \cdot 4$
\item $5 \cdot -4$
\end{itemize}



Only one of these options gives a linear term of $-k$.


$k^2 - k - 20 = (k + 4) \cdot (k + (-5))$

$k^2 - k - 20 = (k + 4) \cdot (k - 5)$



Now we can replace the original equation with an equivalent one:


$(k + 4) (k - 5) = 0$



Applying the zero product property tells us that either $k + 4 = 0$ or $k - 5 = $.  The solution set is $\{ -4, 5 \}$





\end{example}



















\begin{example} Common Factor


Solve $3t e^t - (t-1) e^t = 0$

\textbf{\textcolor{purple!50!blue!90!black}{SOLUTION}}



This expression is a difference of two terms and each term has $e^t$ as a factor.  Therefore, we will apply the Distributive Property.



$e^t (3t - (t-1))= 0$


We can simplify the parentheses.



$e^t (2t +1)= 0$



The zero product property tells us that either $e^t = 0$ or $2t + 1 = 0$.  \\

The function $f(t) = e^t$ has no zeros. 


$2t + 1 = 0$, when $t = -\frac{1}{2}$

We have one solution: $\left\{ -\frac{1}{2} \right\}$


\end{example}
