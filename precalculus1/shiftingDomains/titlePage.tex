The \textbf{Elementary Functions} is a collection of functions for which we know their algebraic properties.

They include 

\begin{itemize}
\item constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, and other polynomials
\item rational
\item roots and radicals
\item exponential and logarithmic
\item trigonometric
\item absolute value, greatest integer, other individual functions
\end{itemize}



This section will just introduce the library of elementary functions with some basic defining features.  We will develop the algebra in future sections.














\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item be introduced to the library.
\item identify basic defining features and characteristics.
\end{itemize}
