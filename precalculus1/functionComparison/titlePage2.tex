Our functions eventually settle down into simple patterns.  

The patterns include

\begin{itemize}
\item approach a constant function
\item approach a linear function
\item continue an oscillating pattern
\item approach a some basic elementary function 
\end{itemize}


Mostly, we are interested in approaching a constant function.  These correspond to horizontal asymptotes on the graph.

Then we are interested in linear patterns (oblique asymptotes)

Then we are interesting in if the funciton becomes unbounded.

Mostly.


But, even more important than these end-behavior discoveries is HOW we decide.

Estanblishing these end-behavior often requires a comparison of end-behavior between functions.  


If functions are each tending to infinity, do they do this differently?


















\subsection{Expectations}


\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item compare endbehavior of functions.
\item establish an order of dominance.
\end{itemize}
