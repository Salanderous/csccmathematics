\begin{idea} Horse Race \#1


Let two horses start together at the starting line. Suppose the first horse always runs faster than the second horse during the whole race.

Then the first horse wins the race.


\end{idea}





Function Translation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f$ and $g$ be functions defined on the interval $[a, b]$. 
\item Suppose $f'(x) > g'(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. 
\end{itemize}

Under these circumstances, we can conclude that $f(b) > g(b)$.













\begin{idea} Horse Race \#2


Let two horses start together at the starting line. Suppose the first horse always runs faster than the second horse during the whole race.

Then the first horse is ahead during the whole race.


\end{idea}





Function Translation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f$ and $g$ be functions defined on the interval $[a, b]$. 
\item Suppose $f'(x) \geq g'(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. 
\end{itemize}

Under these circumstances, we can conclude that $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.






\begin{example} $sin(x)$


Let S$(x) = sin(x)$

We have seen that the derivative of $sin(x)$ is $cos(x)$.

$S'(x) = cos(x)$.

Let $L(x) = x$.  This is a linear function, and as such has a constant rate-of-change of $1$.  Therefore, $L'(x) = 1$. 


\begin{itemize}
\item We have two functions: $sin(x)$ and $x$. 
\item These two functions are equal at $0$: $S(0) = sin(0) = 0$ and $L(0) = 0$.
\item $L'(x) \geq S'(x)$ for every $x \in [0,1]$.
\end{itemize}




Therefore, we can conclude that $x \geq sin(x)$ on $[0,1]$.

The graph of $y = x$ will always be above the graph of $y = sin(x)$, which is not so easy to see visually near $0$.

\begin{idea} Horse Race \#3

Suppose the first horse in a race always runs faster than the second horse during the whole race.

Suppose further than the two horses end the race in a tie.

Then the secon horse is ahead during the whole race.


\end{idea}





Function Translation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $f$ and $g$ be functions defined on the interval $[a, b]$. 
\item Suppose $f'(x) \geq g'(x)$ for every $x \in [a,b]$. 
\item Suppose $f(b) = g(b)$
\end{itemize}

Under these circumstances, we can conclude that $g(x) \geq f(x)$ for all $x \in [a,b]$.
