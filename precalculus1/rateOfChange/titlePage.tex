As we have seen, there are a couple of aspects to functions that drive our investigations.

$\blacktriangleright$ One is a \textbf{point-wise} view.  What is the function value at each domain number? \\


$\blacktriangleright$ The other is a \textbf{rate} view.  How are the function values changing? \\



When comparing functions, it is not enough to compare their values at each domain number.  There are too many.  We need to move faster.  We need to predict what is going to happen. That is where rates-of-change come in.




We need to know the rate-of-change over intervals and when the rate-of-change changes.
