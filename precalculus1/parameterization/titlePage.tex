Functions are packages of three sets: a domain, a range, and a set of pairs, together with one rule - every domain items is in exactly one pair.

Representing functions is a different story.

Functions vary so much that one method of representing them isn't enough.  We have listing tools.  We have algebraic tools for exactness.  We have graphical tools for a global perspective. Graphs of function span the spectrum from smooth and contunuous to extremely chopped up.

The nice graphs of functions belong to a larger category called curves.

We have introduced algebraic curves, which are a picture of solutions to a polynomial equation.

As we work with Cartesian equations, we are learning that they are difficult to handle.

I this section, we introduce a different way of describing curves called \textbf{parameterization}
