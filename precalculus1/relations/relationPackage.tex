We view the world through relationships. That is some information is connected to other information for some reason. These associations are how we navigate thorugh our lives.

\begin{itemize}
\item Dishes have ingredients.
\item Movies have actors.
\item Roads have speed limits.
\item People have social security numbers.
\item Kindergarteners like ice cream flavors.
\item Measurements are quoted in different units.
\item Authors write books.
\item Students get course grades.
\item Mountains have heights.
\item Family's have trees.
\item Businesses have open hours.
\end{itemize}


All of these relationships are different and yet the same.  Some relationships can be viewed as objects possessing characteristics. Some relationships can be viewed if-then statements.  Some relationships can be viewed as cause and effect. But, they can all be viewed as to collections with associated elements.







\begin{definition} \textbf{relation} 
A relation is a package containing three sets or collections. One set is called the \textbf{domain}. One set is called the \textbf{codomain}.  Finally, there is a set of pairings.  Each pairing pairs a member of the domain witha memmber of the codomain.
