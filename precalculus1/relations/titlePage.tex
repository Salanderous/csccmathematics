\begin{model}

\begin{itemize}
\item What ingredients are needed to make chili?
\item Who was in House of Wax (1953)?
\item What is the speed limit on Route 3?
\item What is Mary's social security number?
\item What ice cream flavors does Kevin like?
\item What is $32^\circ F$ in Celsius?
\item Provide a list of good mystery books and their authors.
\item Did you pass Chemistry?
\item How high is Mt. Everest?
\item Who are Timothy's neices?
\item What are the Post Office's hours?
\end{itemize}

We understand our world through connections between things. We might view this as characteristics or attributes of something.  \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Mt Everest is $29,029 ft$ tall.
\end{itemize}


We might experience this as an if-then statement.
\begin{itemize}
\item If you are driving on Route 3, then do not go over 35 mph.
\end{itemize}



We might experience this as casue and effect.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Post Office is closed, becasue it is 9:00pm.
\end{itemize}



All of these ideas have the same structure.  There are two sets or collections of things.  Items in each set are connected or associated with one another.



\begin{example}
\item There is a set or collection ofg movies and a set or collection of actors.  A movie is associated with an actor if the actor appeared in the movie.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
\item There is a set of 9-digits numbers and a collection of U.S. citizens.  A number is connected to a person if that person was issued the number as the social secutiry number.
\end{example}


This structure is called a \dfn{relation}. This section explores relations and how we communicate about them.

\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In  this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item view a relation as a package.
\item encode relation paires as ordered pairs.
\item decipher ordered pairs into relation pairs.
\item trace connections back-and-forth.
\end{itemize}
