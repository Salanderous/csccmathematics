Functions are relations, which makes them packages.  They contain three sets.  They contain a set of real numbers called the \textbf{domain}.  They contain a seond set of real numbers called the \textbf{range}. Finally, they contain a third set of pairs of numbers.  The pairs are all constructed with a number from each of the domain and range.

The pairs the point of the function.  The pairs are the connection between the domain and range.  They identify which numbers are associated together from both sets.

We can talk about these pairs one by one with \textbf{function notation}.
