Functions are relations, which makes them packages.  They contain three sets.  They contain a set of real numbers called the \textbf{domain}.  They contain a seond set of real numbers called the \textbf{range}. Finally, they contain a third set of pairs of numbers.  The pairs are all constructed with a number from each of the domain and range. The defining characteristic of a function is that each domain number is in exactly one pair.

The pairs are the reason we study functions.  The pairs are the connection between the domain and range.  They identify which numbers are associated together from both sets. They itemize the association between the domain and range.

Therefore, it comes as no surprise, that we have a toolbox full of tools to help us describe these pairs.


\section{Function Notation}

We have some shorthand notation to help us communicate individual pairs: $F(d) = r$.  $F(d)$ is called \textbf{function notation}. The name of the function is followed by a domain number inside parentheses. We noe have at least three uses of parentheses.

\begin{notation}  Parentheses \\

Mathematics overuses symbols and allows the context in whch the symbol is used to affect their meaning.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Grouping:} $(3+5)(6+7)$ is a product.  Grouping expressions signals multiplication and the mulitplication sign is omitted.
		\item \textbf{Ordered Pairs:} $(4, 5)$ is an ordered pair and might represent the coordinates of a point in the Catesian Plane.
		\item \textbf{Function Notation:} $Double(5)$ symbolizes a range element that is paired with $5$ from the domain in the \textit{Double} function. It is not multiplication.
	\end{itemize}


The context in which parentheses are used helps the reader interpret the parentheses.  And, these contexts can be intertwined.

\[  (Double(5), (3+5)(6+7))    \]
\end{notation}


\textbf{Note:}  The letter $F$ is not part of function notation.  The first part of function notation is thename of the function. The parentheses are always there.  The letter $d$ is in the domain position and can be replaced by any expression representing domain elements.










\section{Graphs}

We have visual tools where $F(d) = r$ is encoded by plotting a dot at $(d, r)$ on the Cartesian Plane.  Graphs are drawings, which makes them inherently inaccurate.  They are not exact tools.  They are global tools.  They give a big picture of the function pairs.  From this bird's eye view, we can see trends in the function values, extreme function values, and important function values. The global perspective quickly communicates all characteristics and locates function features.












\section{Formulas}
We also want exactness!

The price we pay for exactness is that we can only investigate the function, one pair at a time.  Our tools for this type of investigation are called \textbf{formulas} and \textbf{equations}.
