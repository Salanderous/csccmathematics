Shifting was the result of adding constants to the argument of a function's formula or to the value of a function.  The shape of the graph remained rigid. The graph just slid to a new position. 



A graph does not remain rigid under the act of \textbf{stretching} or \textbf{compressing}, however, it does maintain its general shape. Mulitplication by a constant, either on the domain or range, unevenly stretches or compress the characteristics of a function, but those characteristics still exist.






















\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item examine the effects of stretching a domain.
\item examine the effects of stretching a range.
