When two quantities are \textbf{proportional}, then they are connected by a linear function of the form $f(x) = m x$.  The ratio of corresponding amounts is a constant: $\frac{f(x)}{x} = m$.   

The graph is a line going through the origin with slope $m$.  This means that the ratio of change is also a constant - the same constant $\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} = m$. 

The value of one quantity is always the same multiple of the other quantity.




\begin{example}
In a simple circuit with a fixed resistor, the flow of current through the resistor, $I$, and the voltage drop across the resistor, $V$, are proportial.

\[   V = R I  \]

Here the rate-of-change is the resistance, $R$.  It is the multiplier.   When the current changes, that change is multiplied by $R$ giving the corresponding change in voltage $V$.


\end{example}







We can also change multiple proportions together.



\begin{example}

Water rushes through a turbine, which turns a generator to make electricity. The water posses potential energy, but not all of this energy is transmitted through the turbine.  The turbine has an 86\% efficiency. The energy is the processed through the generator at an efficiency 92\%.

Suppose the generator produces $864 \, gigaJoules$ of energy in the form  of electricity.  What amount of energy did the water originally hold?


We have two proportions:

\begin{itemize}
\item $T = 0.86 W$
\item $G = 0.92 T$
\end{itemize} 

Combining these gives 
\[   G = 0.92 T = 0.92 0.86 W   \]

\[   864 \, gigaJoules = 0.92 0.86 W    \]


\[   1092 \, gigaJoules = W    \]





\end{example}


Written in function language, the two proportions would have looked like

\begin{itemize}
\item $T(W) = 0.86 W$
\item $G(T) = 0.92 T$
\end{itemize} 

And, the chaining would have look like, $G(T(W)) = 0.92 (0.86 W))$.  In the function world, this is known as \textbf{composition}.
