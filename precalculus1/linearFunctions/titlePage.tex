\maketitle









Our first investigation into the Elementary Functions is with linear functions. The distinguishing characteristic about linear functions is that they have a constant growth rate or rate-of-change.  From this we discover that linear functions are those functions that can be described as

\[  L(d) = A \cdot d + B \]

where $A$ and $B$ are real numbers and $A \ne 0$.


The graphs of linear functions are lines and we would like to be able to work back and forth between the algebra and geometry.




















\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will 

\begin{itemize}
\item examine constant growth rates.
\item produce graphs of linear functions.
\item produce formulas from graphs.
\item create tangent lines.
\item solve systems of linear equations.
\end{itemize}
