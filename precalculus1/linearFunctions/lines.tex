Linear functions are those functions with a constant growth rate or rate-of-change.  If you select any two distinct numbers from the domain of a linear function and calculate the rate-of-change, you will get the same number, no matter which two domain numbers you select.

Suppose $L$ is a linear function and $a \ne b$ are two numbers in the domain of $L$. Then, 

\[    \frac{L(b) - L(a)}{b - a} = m   \]

for some constant $m$.


No matter which two numbers you select from the domain of $L$, the rate-of-change always turns out to be $m$.  Each linear function has its own constant rate-of-change.



\begin{example} \textit{nonLinear}

\end{example}

Suppose $f$ is a function, which contains the pairs $(3, 7)$, $(5, 17)$, and $(6, 23)$.


The rate-of-change from $(3, 7)$ to $(5, 17)$ is $\answer{5}$.

The rate-of-change from $(5, 17)$ to $(6, 23)$ is $\answer{6}$.

$f$ is a linear function.
