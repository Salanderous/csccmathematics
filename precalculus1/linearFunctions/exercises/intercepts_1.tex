Let $K(t) = \frac{1}{2} \, t - 3$


On the graph of $y = K(t)$, the $t$-intercept is $\left( \answer{6}, \answer{0} \right)$. \\


On the graph of $y = K(t)$, the $y$-intercept is $\left( \answer{0}, \answer{-3} \right)$.

\begin{exercise}


Let $x(y) = -3 y + 5$


On the graph of $z = x(y)$, the $y$-intercept is $\left( \answer{\frac{5}{3}}, \answer{0} \right)$. \\


On the graph of $z = x(y)$, the $z$-intercept is $\left( \answer{0}, \answer{5} \right)$.

\begin{exercise}


Let $2A - 3B = 4$


A formula for $A(B)$ is $A(B) = \answer{\frac{3}{2}B+2}$ \\

A formula for $B(A)$ is $B(A) = \answer{\frac{2}{3}A - \frac{4}{3}}$ \\


On the graph of $y = A(B)$, the $B$-intercept is $\left( \answer{-\frac{4}{3}}, \answer{0} \right)$. \\


On the graph of $z = B(A)$, the $A$-intercept is $\left( \answer{2}, \answer{0} \right)$.
