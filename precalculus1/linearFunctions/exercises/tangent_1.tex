Below is the graph of $m = M(w) = \frac{1}{10} (w+6) (w+1) (w-3)$ with is natural domain.  The tangent line at the point $\left( 2, -\frac{24}{10} \right)$ is also drawn.

\begin{exercise} Equation

The tangent line above goes through the point $\left( 2, -\frac{24}{10} \right)$ with a slope of $\frac{13}{10}$. \\





Create an equation for this line:  $m = \answer{\frac{13}{10} w-\frac{50}{10}}$. \\

The $w$-intercept of the tangent line is $\left( \answer{\frac{50}{13}}, \answer{0} \right)$


\end{exercise}




\begin{exercise} Function

The line above is the graph of a linear function called $H$.  \\
 
Create a formula for this function:  $H(w) = \answer{\frac{13}{10} w-\frac{50}{10}}$. \\

The of $H$ is $\answer{\frac{50}{13}}$

\end{exercise}










\begin{exercise} Intersection

It appears from the graph that if we extend both graphs to the left, they will intersect at a second intersection point.  This second intersection point is on both graphs, which means that the two functions have the same value at the corresponding domain number.


\[
\frac{1}{10} (w+6) (w+1) (w-3) = \frac{13}{10} (w-2) -\frac{24}{10}
\]



\[
(w+6) (w+1) (w-3) = 13 (w-2) - 24
\]



\[
w^3 + \answer{4} w^2 - \answer{15} w - \answer{18} = 13 w - 50
\]


\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = 0
\]


We know that $2$ is a solution to this, because the tangent point is an intersection point where the two functions would be equal.  Therefore, $w-2$ must be a factor.  The other factor must be a quadratic, since together their product is a cubic.



\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = (w - 2) \cdot (A \, w^2 + B \, w + C)
\]


Let's multiply out the left side and equate coefficients.


\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = (w - 2) \cdot (A \, w^2 + B \, w + C)
\]


\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = A \, w^3 + (B - 2A) \, w^2 + (C - 2B) \, w - 2C
\]


From this, we can see that   $A = \answer{1}$ and $C = \answer{-16}$.

Substituting these value in gives us



\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = w^3 + (B - 2) \, w^2 + (-16 - 2B) \, w + 32
\]


Comparing the $w^2$-term, we see that $B = \answer{6}$.






\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = (w - 2) \cdot (w^2 + 6 \, w - 16)
\]


This quadratic factors.



\[
w^3 + 4 w^2 - \answer{28} w + \answer{32} = (w - 2) \left( w - \answer{2} \right) \left( w + \answer{8} \right)
\]



The solution that corresonds to our second intersection point is $\answer{-8}$. \\

The other intersection point is $\left( -8, -\frac{154}{10} \right)$.



\end{exercise}


\textbf{Note:}  The tangent point corresponded to a double root and a double factor - a factor with a multiplcity (exponent) of $2$.
