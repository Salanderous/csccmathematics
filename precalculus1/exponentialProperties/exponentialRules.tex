The algebra of exponents are grouped into those with the same base...



\begin{itemize}
\item $A^n \cdot A^m = A^{n+m}$
\item $\frac{A^n}{A^m} = A^{n-m}$
\item $(A^n)^m = A^{n \cdot m}$ \\
\end{itemize}

...and those with the same exponent. 

\begin{itemize}
\item $A^n \cdot B^n = (A \cdot B)^n$
\item $\frac{A^n}{B^n} = \left(\frac{A}{B}\right)^n$ \\
\end{itemize}




These lead to equalities such as



\begin{itemize}
\item $A^0 = 1$
\item $A^1 = A$
\item $A^{-n} = \frac{1}{A^n}$
\end{itemize}




We have also seen that exponential functions are \textbf{one-to-one}. One-to-one means that each range number is paired with a unique domain number.





\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
            domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            axis lines =center, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$, grid = major,
            ytick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
          	xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
          	ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            axis on top
          ]
          
      		\addplot [line width=2, penColor, smooth,samples=200,domain=(-10:0.6),<->] {0.33 * 2^(x+5)-7};

          	\addplot [line width=1, gray, dashed,samples=200,domain=(-10:10),<->] {-7};


      		\addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-5,-6.66)};

Our definition of functions includes a similar rule for domain numbers.  Each domain number is in exactly one pair.  One-to-one puts the same restrictions on range numbers.  Each range number is in exactly one pair.  Exponential functions have this feature.

In other words, each function value occurs exactly once in an exponential.  This is handy information when solving equations.


If you know that $A^r = A^t$, then $r=t$ follows. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ This is an important rule.


\begin{fact} Uniqueness


\[     \text{If } \,  A^r = A^t, \,  \text{ then }  \, r=t    \]


\end{fact}




\begin{example} Solving Equations


Solve $5^m = 25$



$5^m = 25$

$5^m = 5^2$    Since, $5^x$ is a one-to-one function.

$m = 2$

\end{example}










\begin{example} Solving Equations


Solve $2^{2k+1} = 32$



$2^{2k+1} = 32$

$2^{2k+1} = 2^{\answer{5}}$

$\answer{2k + 1} = 5$    Since, $2^x$ is a one-to-one function.

$k = 2$

\end{example}






\begin{example} Solving Equations


Solve $9^{-x + 2} = 27^{x-1}$




$9^{-x + 2} = 27^{x-1}$

$(3^2)^{-x + 2} = (3^3)^{x-1}$

$3^{-2x+4} = 3^{3x-3}$    

$-2x + 4 = \answer{3x - 3}$    Since, $3^x$ is a one-to-one function.

$7 = 5x$


$\frac{7}{5} = x$

\end{example}














\section{e}


You know the number $\pi$ (pronounced "pie").  The definition of $\pi$ is kind of weird.  For any circle, $\pi$ is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter.

$\pi$ is approximately $3.1415926$.





There is another number that comes up quite frequently when dealing with naturla growth.  This number called "e" and its symbol is $e$.

$e$ is approximately $2.718281828$.

The definition of $e$ is even weirder. \\


Consider the function $e(x) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x$



\begin{center}
\desmos{cmurxtv0dc}{400}{300}
\end{center}


This function is an increasing function, but it increases at a smaller and smaller rate.  The graph starts to level off and approaches a horizontal asymptote.  This asymptote is at a height of $e$.  And that is the definition of $e$


\[   e = \lim_{x \to \infty}  \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x      \]


















\begin{example} Solving Equations


Solve $\sqrt{e^{-x + 2}} = \frac{1}{e^{3x-1}}$




$e^{\tfrac{-x + 2}{2}}= e^{-3x-1}$


$\frac{-x + 2}{2} = \answer{-3x-1}$    Since, $e^x$ is a one-to-one function.

$-x + 2 = -6x - 2$

$\answer{5x} = -4$


$-\frac{4}{5} = x$

\end{example}
