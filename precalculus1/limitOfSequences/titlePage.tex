We have seen a common structure in several mathematical situations - the idea of a limit.


$\blacktriangleright$ Decimal numbers or expansions are a sequence of digits that go on forever.  The sequence gets closer to a number. If you stop at any place, then you don't have the limiting number. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ Rational functions and exponential functions have an end-behavior, which appears as a horizontal asymptote on the graph.  The function values get closer and closer to the asymptotic value.  If you stop at any place, then you don't have the limiting value. \\


$\blacktriangleright$ Sequences do the same thing. \\


We can create a sequence of numbers. The numbers might get closer and closer to a limiting number.  They might not. \\




In some cases, the sequence does not head toward a limiting number. In some cases, we might know the limiting number is there, but have little information about it.  So, we end up with two questions.



\begin{itemize}
\item Does the sequence have a limiting value?
\item If so, what is the number?
\end{itemize}
