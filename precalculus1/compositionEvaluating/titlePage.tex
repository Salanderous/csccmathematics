Functions are packages containing three sets: a domain, a range, and a set of pairs.

We can also view functions as machines.  They take input from the domain, process it, and return an output from the range.  For each input, the process produces exactly one output.



This output could easily be in the domain of another function, and available for input to this seocond function.
