Functions, like numbers, are a system with operations.  With some attention to domains,

\begin{itemize}
\item the sum of two functions is another function.
\item the difference of two functions is another function.
\item the product of two functions is another function.
\item the quotient of two functions is another function.
\end{itemize}


The usual attention to domains includes adopting the intersection of domains to be the new domain, and avoiding domain numbers which make the denominator equal to $0$.



Functions have another operation: \textbf{composition}.

We have already taken the single output of one functio9n and used it as the input to anther function.  We can extend this idea to the whole function.


The \textbf{composition of F and G}, symbolized by $F \circ G$ or $F(G)$, is a new function.  Its domain comes from the domain of $G$. Its range comnes from the range of $F$.



In this section, we will restrict our study to the composition of linear functions.
