Let's extend our composition of linear functions to piecewise linear functions.








The domain of $T \circ g$ is $\left( -1, \answer{2} \right]$.



\textbf{Now for the formulas} \\


We have a composition: $T \circ g$.  We know this is a piecewise linear function, because it is the composition of two piecewise linear functions. \\

Our composition has a formula, let's use $c$ for its variable. \\
