Let's extend our composition of linear functions to piecewise linear functions.








The domain of $T \circ g$ is $\left( -1, \answer{\frac{1}{2}} \right] \cup \left( \frac{16}{7}, \answer{4} \right] \cup \left[ \frac{36}{7}, \answer{8} \right)$ \\


\textbf{Now for the formulas} \\


We have a composition: $T \circ g$.  We know this is a piecewise linear function, because it is the composition of two piecewise linear functions. \\

Our composition has a formula, let's use $c$ for its variable. \\
