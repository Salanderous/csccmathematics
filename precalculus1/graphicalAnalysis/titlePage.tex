Functions are packages containing three sets, one of which is a set of pairs.  That is the struture of a function.  However, the sets are often measurments and the function is how we compare those measurements.

We would like to know things like:

\begin{itemize}
\item When one measurement increases, does the other also increase?
\item When one measurement increases, does the other decrease?
\item Do the measurements change similarly?
\item When one measurement changes quickly, does the other change quickly or slowly?
\item What are the maximum and minimum measurements?
\item Which measurement is connected to the other's maximum or minimum?
\end{itemize}


In this section, we will introduce this type of function analysis via graphs. Once we gain a familiarity with this type of analysis, we will extend our thinking to include formulas.











\begin{sectionOutcomes}
In this section, students will...

\begin{itemize}
\item identify intervals where function is increasing and decreasing.
\item locate maximum and minimums.
\item locate zeros.
\end{itemize}
\end{sectionOutcomes}
