minimum and maximum
\end{abstract}
\maketitle



When using functions to analyze situations, we are often interested in the maximum and minimum values that a function takes on. These are often called \textbf{extreme} values. We would like to know the extreme values and where, in the domain, they occur.



There are two views on extreme values.

\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Global Extreme Values}} 

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{global maximum value} is the greatest value of the function.  

\[  f(c) \text{ is a global maximum if } f(x) \leq f(c) \text{ for all } x \text{ in the domain of } f \]

\item The \textbf{global minimum value} is the least value of the function.  

\[  f(c) \text{ is a global minimum if } f(c) \leq f(x) \text{ for all } x \text{ in the domain of } f \]
\end{itemize}

A function has at most, one maximum value and one minimum value, but they can occur at multiple domain numbers.



\end{definition}




\begin{warning}

\begin{itemize}
\item A global maximum may occur at multiple domain numbers.  
\item A function can also not have a maximum value.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item A global minimum may occur at multiple domain numbers.  
\item A function can also not have a minimum value.
\end{itemize}

\end{warning}

















In contrast to a single maximum or minimum value, a function may also have values which are the greatest value in their own little neighborhood.  We see these as tops of hills and bottom of valleys on the graph.  A function may have many of these \textbf{local} or \textbf{relative} extrema.






\begin{definition} \textbf{\textcolor{green!50!black}{Local Extreme Values}} 
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(c)$ is a \textbf{local maximum value} of the function $f$ if there exists an $0 < \epsilon$ such that $f(x) \leq f(c)$ for all domain numbers, $x$, within a distance of $\epsilon$ from $c$. 

\[  f(c) \text{ is a local maximum if } f(x) \leq f(c) \text{ for all } \{ x \in domain \, | \, x \in (c - \epsilon, c + \epsilon) \} \text{ for some } \epsilon > 0 \]







\item $f(c)$ is a \textbf{local minimu value} of the function $f$ if there exists an $0 < \epsilon$ such that $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all domain numbers, $x$, within a distance of $\epsilon$ from $c$. 



\[  f(c) \text{ is a local minimum if } f(c) \leq f(x) \text{ for all } \{ x \in domain \, | \, x \in (c - \epsilon, c + \epsilon) \} \text{ for some } \epsilon > 0 \]
\end{itemize}

\end{definition}





By default, all global extrema are automatically local extrema.






\begin{example} Extrema \\

Let $g(k)$ be a function.  The graph of $y= g(k)$ is displayed below. 

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
            	domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,
            	axis lines =center, xlabel=$k$, ylabel=$y$,
                ytick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
                xtick={-10,-8,-6,-4,-2,2,4,6,8,10},
                ticklabel style={font=\scriptsize},
            	every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
            	every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
            	axis on top,
          		]

        
        \addplot [draw=penColor, very thick, smooth, domain=(-8:5), ->] {0.05*(x+7)*(x+2)*(x-3)};
        %\addplot [draw=penColor, very thick, smooth, domain=(-1:3)] {0.5*x-1};
        %\addplot [draw=penColor, very thick, smooth, domain=(4:8)] {-2*x+10};


        \addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-8,-3.3)};
        %\addplot[color=penColor,fill=white,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-3,3)};


    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\begin{itemize}
\item $g$ has no global maximum.
\item The global minimum of $g$ is $-3.3$, which occurs at $-8$.
\item $g$ has a local minimum of $-3.3$, which occurs at $-8$ and a local minimum of $-2.5$, which occurs at $0.9$.
\item $g$ has a local maximum of $2.4$, which occurs at $-4.9$
\end{itemize}

\end{example}






Let's run through the idea of a local extrema for the previous example. \\


\begin{explanation} \textit{Local Explanations}




$\blacktriangleright$ $g$ has a local minimum of $-2.5$, which occurs at $0.9$. \\


Let $0 < \epsilon = 0.3$.  \\
$g(0.9) \leq g(k)$ for all $k$ in the domain within a distance of $0.3$ from $0.9$, which would be the interval $\left(\answer{0.6}, \answer{1.2}\right)$.




$\blacktriangleright$ $g$ has a local maximum of $2.4$, which occurs at $-4.9$. \\






Let $0 < \epsilon = 0.4$.  \\
$g(k) \leq g(-4.9)$ for all $k$ in the domain within a distance of $0.4$ from $-4.9$, which would be the interval $\left(\answer{-5.3}, \answer{-4.6}\right)$.




$\blacktriangleright$ $g$ has a local minimum of $-3.3$, which occurs at $-8$. \\





Let $0 < \epsilon = 0.5$.  $g(-8) \leq g(k)$ for all $k$ in the domain within a distance of $0.5$ from $-8$, which would be the interval $\left[\answer{-8}, \answer{-7.5}\right)$.


\end{explanation}


\textbf{Note:} As the previous example illustrates, global extrema are also local extrema. \\
\textbf{Note:} We picked $0.3$, $0.4$, and $0.5$ for $\epsilon$, but we could have selected any small, positive numbers.



\begin{example} Extrema \\

Let $B(w)$ be a function.  The graph of $y = B(w)$ is displayed below. 

\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
     \begin{axis}[
            	domain=-10:10, ymax=10, xmax=10, ymin=-10, xmin=-10,

            	axis on top,
          		]

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\begin{itemize}
\item $B$ has no global maximum.
\item The global minimum of $B$ is $-2.5$, which occurs at $1.4$.
\item $B$ has a local minimum of $-2.5$, which occurs at $1.4$ and a local minimum of $-0.7$, which occurs at $-5.9$.
\item $B$ has a local maximum of $0.25$, which occurs at $-3$
\end{itemize}

\end{example}


\textit{Local Explanations} \\

Let $0 < \epsilon = 0.6$.  $B(1.4) \leq B(w)$ for all $w$ in the domain within a distance of $\answer{0.6}$ from $\answer{1.4}$, which would be the interval $(0.8, 2)$.

Let $0 < \epsilon = 0.25$.  $B(-5.9) \leq B(w)$ for all $w$ in the domain within a distance of $\answer{0.25}$ from $\answer{-5.9}$, which would be the interval $(-6.15, -5.65)$.

Let $0 < \epsilon = 0.5$.  $B(w) \leq B(-3)$ for all $w$ in the domain within a distance of $\answer{0.5}$ from $\answer{-3}$, which would be the interval $(-3.5, -2.5)$.

Let $T(p)$ be a function.  The graph of $y=  T(p)$ is displayed below.

        \addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-8,-2)};

        \addplot[color=penColor,fill=white,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(-1,1)};

        \addplot[color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(3,-6)};

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ has no global maximum.
\item $T$ has no global minimum.
\item $T$ has a local minimum of $-2$, which occurs at $-8$.
\item $T$ has a local minimum of $\answer{-6}$, which occurs at $3$.
\item $T$ has a local maximum of $\answer{6}$, which occurs at $-1$.
\end{itemize}

\end{example}





It appears that $8$ would have been the global maximum of $T$, however, the point $(-8, 8)$ is missing from the graph and $8$ is not in the range.  And, there is no real number "just below $8$".  If you choose any real number, $r$, below $8$ to be the possible candidate for global maximum, there is the number $\frac{8+r}{2}$. This number is in the range and $r < \frac{8+r}{2} < 8$.  You cannot identify a specific number as the maximum, so there isn't one.








\begin{explanation} \textit{Local Explanations}


Let $0 < \epsilon = \answer{0.5}$.  $B(-8) \leq B(w)$ for all $w$ in the domain within a distance of $0.5$ from $-8$, which would be the interval $[-8, -7.5)$.

Let $0 < \epsilon = \answer{0.4}$.  $B(3) \leq B(w)$ for all $w$ in the domain within a distance of $0.4$ from $3$, which would be the interval $(3.4, 2.6)$.

Let $0 < \epsilon = \answer{0.3}$.  $B(w) \leq B(-1)$ for all $w$ in the domain within a distance of $0.3$ from $-1$, which would be the interval $(-1.3, -0.7)$.
