\begin{exercise}
A student claims that $\int \arcsin(x) dx = x \arcsin(x) + \sqrt{1-x^2}+C$.  Indicate whether the student is correct or incorrect. 

\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice[correct]{The student is correct.}  
\choice{The student is incorrect.} 
\end{multipleChoice}

Hint: You may use the fact that $\frac{d}{dx} \arcsin(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}$.  You do not need to antidifferentiate anything to determine this!   While it is obviously easy to earn points for this question, make sure you understand the logic behind how to verify whether this is true or not!
