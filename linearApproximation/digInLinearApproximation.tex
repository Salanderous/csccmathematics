\title[Dig-In:]{Linear approximation}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
We use a method called ``linear approximation'' to estimate the value
of a (complicated) function at a given point.
%  We derive the constant rule, sum rule, power rule, and product rule.

%\section{Linear approximation}

Given a function, a \textit{linear approximation} is a fancy phrase
for something you already know:
\begin{quote}
  \textbf{The line tangent to the graph of a function at a point is very close to the graph of the function near that point.}
\end{quote}
This tangent line is the graph of a linear function, called  the \textbf{linear approximation}.
\begin{example}
Let $f$ be a function that is differentiable on some interval I that contains the point $a$. The graph of a function $f$  and the line tangent to the curve

 $y=f(x)$ at the point where $x=a$ are given in the figure below.
Find the equation of the tangent line.
